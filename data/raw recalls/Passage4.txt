Wild hummingbirds rely on landmarks and not geometry to learn an array of flowers
So far studies point out that most animal species like birds, fish etc rely on visual landmarks and geometrical representation to learn about their surrounding environments to orient and navigate towards their targets. the authors studied whether this is also true for wild hummingbirds (selasphorus rufus), which are more ecologically relevant as the other studies described earlier were in a lab. Wild hummingbirds were trained in an experiment to reach a target within a  rectangular array of flowers, by introducing certain artificial landmarks. The experiment involved moving around a certain visual landmarks or removing it. But each time the hummingbirds were able to orient themselves from natural landmarks and navigate towards the target. The authors concluded that hummingbirds rely only on landmarks and not on the geometry of array of flowers. The authors also say that studies like this could further be conducted in a more ecologically relevant outdoor environment.

Hummingbird's spatial behavior in an array of flowers
When animals such as birds are put in an enclosure corner, it is often the case that they use both the spatial cues, e.g. the relationship between the corners and the walls, as well as the shapes of particular objects in the surrounding to help. But most of these studies are conducted in laboratory controlled environment, and this study is interested in studying whether free-living hummingbird in wild environment also employ the same strategies when they navigate through their spaces. The experimental setting is that the hummingbird are put in a rectangular array of flowers. In controlling the variables, when conducting the experiments, some parts are either moved and removed, to see which strategy the hummingbird are using. What the results find is that there is no clue of the use of the shape of the array, but rather that the hummingbirds make use of the spatial relationship and even the spatial relationships in the surrounding natural environment. This is the first experiment, claimed the experimenters, that makes use of rectangular shape in a natural setting experiment. And further studies can be conducted in studying what exactly the strategy and mechanism are for animals to recognize shapes such as rectangular.

Hummingbirds use landmarks as spatial cues, not geography
Previous studies in laboratory settings on rats, lizards, and fish have demonstrated that these animals used both geography and landmarks to find rewards located in a corner of a rectangular test site. However, no studies to date have attempted to observe the use of these strategies in nature. The present study examined spatial behaviors among Rufous hummingbirds in the wild to examine whether they used geography or physical landmarks to navigate. Observers trained hummingbirds to find a treat in a rectangular flower bed. The observers then removed experimental landmarks to test if the hummingbirds would use the rectangular geometry of the flower bed to locate the treat. The study offered no evidence that hummingbirds use geography to navigate; rather, they used the test landmarks and/or other physical landmarks to find the treat.

Mockingbirds use landmarks not geometry to find flowers
In an experiment in which mockingbirds seek out flowers for food, mockingbirds were found to use landmarks that were part of the study, rather than the actual array and geometry of flowers, to find food.

Hummingbirds use landmarks instead of geometry to learn an array of flowers
Rats, birds, and fish have remembered reward locations based on a visual reference or the geometry of walls and corners. However, this is always conducted in a controlled lab simulation, while the current study observes wild hummingbirds as they would behave in their natural environment. One reward location was placed in a rectangular array of flowers, marked with visual markers that would be added or removed throughout the course of the experiment. The results showed that hummingbirds learned the reward location based on the manipulated or natural landmarks rather than the geometry of the flowers. This was the first study conducted with rectangular geometry, and more are suggested to follow.

Wild hummingbirds rely on landmarks instead of geometry for location of reward
Rats, birds, and fish rely on landmarks and the geometry of the walls and floor when locating the reward. However, this is done in laboratory settings so this experiment was conducted in the natural setting. The subjects were wild hummingbirds. Once they learned that the reward was within a rectangular array of flowers nearby both experimental and natural landmarks, some of the positions of the experimental landmarks were changed. The hummingbirds did not rely on the geometric/rectangular array of the flowers but on these landmarks to locate the reward.

Wild hummingbirds rely on landmarks not geometry in spatial memory of flower arrangement
Rats, fish, and birds in laboratory settings rely both on nearby landmarks and geometric arrangement to identify a location of interest, for example, walls forming a corner. However, these studies fail to capture the environment that an animal encounters in nature. Researchers sought to test whether wild hummingbirds employ both of these tools (landmarks and geometric arrangement) in seeking flowers in their natural environments. The researchers allowed the hummingbirds to familiarize themselves with the environment, and changed the environment with test probes of moving or removing landmarks. Their observations showed that wild hummingbirds did not rely at all on geometric arrangement of flowers, but rather on nearby landmarks, and potentially other, farther, natural landmarks.

Hummingbirds locate and orient themselves through geographical landmarks, not geometrical shapes
Rats, turtles and other animals, in the setting of a laboratory, are able to find and locate themselves using visual cues and geographical shapes. However, these experiments, being primarily in labs, cannot speak to what would happen in nature. To test this, hummingbirds in nature were tested. Treats were hidden in a given array, and the humming birds were released to find it. Once they did, some parts of the set up would either be moved or removed completely. The hummingbirds were able to find the treats easily afterwards. It is thought that instead of relying on geometrical shapes like rats and other species do, hummingbirds in the wild orient themselves and other things using geographical landmarks.

Wild hummingbirds recognize locations based on landmarks, not geometry
Researchers have observed that animals can learn the location of objects and food based on geometric layouts (such as the corner of a room). However, this hasn't been tested in more natural settings with wild animals. The authors observed wild rufus hummingbirds learn the location of a grid of flowers. Then, they experimented by altering the rectangular arrangement of the flowers in one case, and by moving or removing artificial landmarks they had placed nearby in another. They observed that the landmarks were the only thing which influenced the hummingbirds' actions, indicating that wild hummingbirds identify locations based on landmarks (in this case, likely both artificial and natural). Further research with other animals should be conducted.

Hummingbirds navigate by landmarks not geometry
Existing literature has found that fish, rats, and birds in tasks where a reward is placed in one corner use both visual features near to the reward and the geometry of the walls and corners to navigate. Because these experiments were in lab conditions, we tested hummingbirds in the wild with a rectangular array of flowers, only one of which contained the reward. We believe this to be the first animal study on rectangular geometry in the wild. After we altered our landmarks and the flowers in the array, it was clear that the hummingbirds exclusively used landmarks, possibly including nearby natural landmarks, to navigate, and not the geometry of the array. We recommend further experiments be conducted in an ecological context.

Hummingbirds use landmarks and not geometry to retain spatial information
Test conduction in non-human primates, birds and reptiles indicate that these animals use geometric information such as the shape and the corners of enclosures to remember spatial information. Since these test environments are artificial, a more natural setting was used to test strategies used by hummingbirds to retain spatial information. A rectangular array of flowers with some landmarks around it was used to find out how hummingbirds remembered specific locations - the landmarks were moved between tests. The results indicated that hummingbirds used the landmarks, and not the geometry of the rectangular array, for spatial information. The use of ecologically relevant settings is encouraged to study the strategies used by animals for the retention of spatial information.

Do wild hummingbirds use the geometry of a space to navigate it?
Studies have previously been made around the behavior rat, fish, and birds employ when they are put inside geometrically organized structures and trained to find rewards. These animals have often used the underlying geometry of the space they were in to remember where to find rewards. As part of a study, rufous hummingbirds were kept in a rectangular array of flowers where rewards were hidden for them in one specific location. In the first iteration, hummingbirds went and found the rewards with whichever present landmarks were set up in the array. In the second iteration, those running the study changed one or two landmarks, and probably noticed an adverse effect in the hummingbirds' ability to locate the reward. The authors concluded that hummingbirds probably don't form complex geometric representations of the spaces they occupy as their primary way of foraging. The authors suggest that studies that investigate animals' interaction with the geometric structures enclosing them are fairly novel.

Wild hummingbirds use landmarks, not geometric relationships, to find rewards.
Birds, rats and fish use both geometric arrangements and nearby landmarks to remember the location of rewards in enclosed rectangular containers. But these studies are very controlled; few studies have been done to demonstrate how animals find rewards in the wild. Scientists studied wild hummingbirds to see how the birds remembered and found rewards in a rectangular area of flowers. In a rectangular area, researchers placed a reward. After the hummingbirds learned the reward location, two experimental landmarks were moved or removed to see how the hummingbirds' behavior changed while finding the reward. The study found that hummingbirds did not use geometric relationships in the rectangle to find the reward; they relied only on experimental landmarks and possibly geographical landmarks in the area. Further research should be done on animals in the wild to investigate the kinds of scenarios where animals navigate using geometric relationships in the area versus landmarks.

Wild living humming birds rely on landmarks, not geometry
animal in laboratory settings have used unnatural landmarks to remember locations, however wondering if this is present in wild-living hummingbirds. landmarks and rectangular arrangement of flowers used in experiment
landmarks arranged differently in experiment. Landmarks, NOT GEOMETRY, were the indication that the wild hummingbirds used to determine location

Hummingbirds choose landmarks over geometric patterns
In laboratory studies, animals have often been found to associate reward locations based off of landmark and geometric patterns, such as walls or corners. However, nothing of this sort has been tested for wild animals. This study was meant to test how wild hummingbirds navigate through rectangular arrays of flowers to get to the reward location. The birds were first trained to find a fixed reward location. Then, the reward locations were either removed or relocated. However, the birds had no difficulty finding the rewards. The results show that wild hummingbirds mainly rely on landmarks rather than geometric signs.

Hummingbirds depend on landmarks rather than geometry to navigate to an array of flowers
While animals such as fish, rats, and birds have been shown to depend on geometry to navigate to a resource (in a lab setting), this experiment showed that free, wild hummingbirds do not depend on geometry and instead depend on landmarks to find an array of flowers. For this experiment, flowers were arranged in a rectangle, and probes were used on experimental landmarks. The hummingbirds proved to not depend on the geometry of the flower array when navigating to it, and instead relied upon both the experimental landmarks and even natural landmarks. This experiment was the first in these geometry studies to use rectangles.

Hummingbirds use landmarks, not geometry, to learn reward locations
Rats and fish have been shown to learn reward locations by geometry by using the walls and floor to learn a specific corner of the cage. Since animals might behave differently in enclosed environments, this study wanted to learn how wild hummingbirds learned locations by placing a reward location in a rectangular bed of flowers. Scientists found that the hummingbirds did not learn the location by the rectangular bed of flowers, but rather by local landmarks.

Hummingbirds Use Visual Landmarks to Guide Way 
Rats, birds and other test animals often utilize visual landmarks to help find their way to an exit when they are forced to go in a maze or some form of test area. It has been researched and corroborated that these animals utilize corners or visual eccentricities to help discover the proper route in their numerous attempts; however, these results come with a certain degree of artificiality, as the man-made testing maze/spaces are clearly not found naturally in the wild. Scientists thus elected to see whether or not hummingbirds were capable of utilizing natural landmarks, smells, and other sensory triggers to help them follow a particular pathway to escape. It was generally found that the hummingbirds used natural visual landmarks as opposed to artificial ones to help find their way, a clear demonstration of their cognizant recognition of pathways and spatiality.

Wild hummingbirds rely on visual landmarks rather than geometric analysis in their navigation.
The research experiment aimed to discover whether wild hummingbirds used geometric analysis or visual landmarks in navigation. Previous research had demonstrated that rats, birds and fish used a combination of geometric analysis and visual landmarks in performing various natural tasks. The wild hummingbirds were placed in a rectangular array of flowers and observed in their navigation toward food sources. The experiment demonstrated that the wild hummingbirds relied primarily on visual landmarks, such as corners and angles, rather than the overall geometric layout of the environment they were placed in. The authors of this study believe that this is the first study of its kind to consider the use of geometric analysis by animals in navigation.

Wild Hummingbirds do not use geometry to locate flowers
Many species of fish and bird in closed experiments are able to locate a prize based on the location of landmarks as well as the geometry of the corners and walls of the experiment. However, little is known of whether wild species navigate to certain locations using primarily landmarks or geometries. In this study, wild hummingbirds were trained to locate flowers in the corner of a rectangular area. Then, landmarks in the rectangle were moved or removed to see how this affected the hummingbirds' abilities to navigate to the flowers again. The hummingbirds seemed not to use the geometry of the space at all, but relied on the placed, and probably naturally occurring, landmarks to navigate. This is the first experiment to be done on wild populations and encourages others to continue exploring the navigational techniques of wild species.
