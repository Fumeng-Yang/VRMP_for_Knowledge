Does social environment influence the learning ability of family-living lizards?
There have been a lot of studies on whether the social environment impacted the learning-ability of birds, fish etc. But no one have studied the social environment influence on reptiles such as family-living skinks (Egernia Striolata). The authors hypothesized that social isolation in family-living skinks would reduce their spatial learning ability. Hence, they conducted an experiment, wherein they split up an offspring breed into two groups 1) raised alone and 2) raised in a pair. The number of skinks in each rearing treatment group was equal. N=14 solitary and N = 4 social. After a year, they quantified the spatial learning capability of two groups and found no difference in learning ability between them. They were surprised with this result. The authors hypothesize that might be the the facultative nature of this species might have contributed to reduced impact of social isolation in this species compared to other social obligate species. The authors conclude that social environment does not influence the spatial learning ability of skinks.

Does early social exposure affect learning ability in family-raised lizards?
Individuals who are socially exposed in early development tend to have greater cognitive learning ability compared with those who develop in isolation. This has been studied in birds and mammals, but has not yet in reptiles. The current study examines the learning ability of family-raised tree skinks. We hypothesized that their learning ability would be compromised if they developed in isolation rather than in a social environment. The experiment divided up tree skinks into two groups: 1) isolated and 2) non-isolated. After 1 year, we examined the tree skinks. The 14 tree skinks all exhibited the same ability to comprehend spatial learning ability. The results were not what we expected. This suggests that early development in isolation does not affect spatial learning ability for this species of tree skinks.

Does social isolation effect cognitive development in family-living lizards?
Previous research on mammals and birds suggests that social isolation at a young age has a negative impact on cognitive development, physiology, and learning ability. However, the impact of social isolation on learning ability in other taxa, such as reptiles, has not been studied. This experiment was intended to study the effect of different rearing conditions on learning ability of the family-living tree skink. The hypothesis was that social isolation would have a negative effect on skinks' ability to learn to perform a certain task. The experiment separated skinks at birth into two groups with different rearing conditions: (1) isolation (N=14); and (2) in pairs (N=14). After 1 year, the experiment tested both isolated and socially-reared skinks' ability to perform a specific task, measuring success at the task, latency to perform the task, number of trials needed to perform the task, and efficiency at completing the task. No difference was observed between isolated and socially-reared skinks' ability to complete the task, including success at the task, latency at performing the task, and the number of trials needed to complete the task. This was an unexpected result, but perhaps the facultative nature of skinks' sociality reduced the impact of rearing conditions on learning ability relative to species with obligate sociality. Overall, the experiment did not provide evidence of an impact of social rearing conditions on learning ability in this family-living lizard.

Does Social environment influence learning ability in a family living lizard. 
In many bird and mammals in the past, research has shown that an early social environment has positive effects on learning ability. Offspring of skinks were exposed at birth to two rearing treatments 1) alone 2) paired to see whether their ability to learn was different based on rearing method. Surprisingly, both groups showed similar results contrary to previous findings, where the number of skinks to try and complete the task, the number of successes completing the task, the latency of completing, was the same for both groups.

Lizards' spatial intelligence in isolation vs social
Lizards were separated into two groups - isolated, and pairs (14 each). After being raised in these different contexts, their spatial intelligence were tested, as well as many other developmental tests. There seemed to be no difference between the intelligence between the two groups, so isolated vs. social doesn't influence spatial intelligence.

Does early social environment shape cognitive learning ability in a family living lizard 
Early social environment is important to identify whether it influences learning ability in many animal species. Offspring of family living skinks were raised with two different rearing environments at birth: 1) alone 2) paired. They hypothesized that those with an early social environment would show better learning abilities than those without. However, the finding showed that both groups showed a similar effect on spatial leaning when given tasks and the time spent on completing the tasks, the number of times they tried, the latency of the task and errors were same across both groups. This showed that early learning environment had no influence on learning ability.

Does social environment influence learning ability in a family-living lizard?
The researchers reared n=14 lizards in isolation and n=14 in family groups. They found that surprisingly, lizards brought up in social isolation performed no worse than lizards brought up in their typical family-style social environments. They were surprised by these results, and theorize that this particular species of lizard may not be so impacted by early life socialization

Does social environment influence learning ability in a family-living lizard?
In mammals and birds, social environment has been observed as influential in learning capabilities. Social isolation has been seen to reduce learning capabilities in these animals. The authors studied whether social isolation affects learning capabilities in a species of tree skink. Two sets of skinks were studied. One was raised in isolation, and the other in pairs. After a year, a series of spacial recognition tasks were used to test learning capabilities of the lizards. Contrary to their hypothesis, there was no appreciable difference between the two groups. This is perhaps a result of the species not having obligate social interactions, as is the case for other species.

The effect of social isolation on the learning ability of a family-living lizard
We tested the effect of social isolation of a social skink species on subsequent spatial learning ability. Research on the cognitive effects of social isolation in social reptile species is currently lacking. We separated our skink eggs into two groups, one of which would go to develop in isolation, and the other, which developed with social interaction, as in the wild. After the skinks entered their next life phase, their performance in a spatial learning task was measured according to five criteria. On all five criteria socially and non-socially reared skinks' scores did not differ significantly, which shows that social isolation during development does not have an impact on later learning in spatial tasks. This finding is surprising, but the facultive nature of this species's social dwelling may explain it, with more detriment to learning ability in species with obligate sociality.

Isolation in early stages of life and learning ability in family-lived lizards
Isolation in the early stages of life are observed to have an impact in mammal and bird species, where those that have been isolated since birth show a lower learning ability. To see if this was true for another species, lizards were tested. The hypothesis was that early isolation will result in a lower learning ability later in life. Two groups of lizards (14 each) were raised for a year. Those in the first group was isolated from birth and those in the the second was placed as a pair. A year later, they were tested in their learning abilities and showed no difference. Although this result was unexpected, it did not come as a surprise ans lizards are less social creatures than mammal and bird species.

Will the social environment of developing reptiles have an effect on their learning?
Animals raised in isolation tend to have a lesser response to learning(in mammals) how about reptiles?
Skinks observed, separated at birth then 14 social environment, 14 isolated. no difference in learning between the two. results were unexpected

Effect of social settings in learning abilities of family-living lizards
In higher order animals such as mammals, the social setting during formative/developmental phases influences learning abilities. In general, animals that are reared in isolation have lower learning abilities that animals that are reared in a more social setting. The hypothesis for the study with tree skinks was that those specimen reared in isolation would possess lower learning abilities than those reared with other skinks. To test this, tree skink were split into two groups of 14 each - one with skinks raised in isolation and the other with skinks raised in pairs. It was observed, however, that individual from both groups possessed similar learning abilities, indicating that the hypothesis was untrue. However, the social setting was facultative, and obligate social settings might yield different results.

Do family-lived lizards have higher learning rates than isolated lizards?
The authors of the study refer to research done on mammals, and animals for whom socialization is forced, and concluded from such research that mammals typically benefit in their learning rates from being socialized during their period of youth as opposed to mammals raised in isolation. They were wondering whether such results can extend to animal species on whom socialization is not forced, such as reptiles, as very little research is done in this direction and could be useful for solving different problems. So they gathered some lizard skinks, and put them in two groups. They created one group of 14 skinks where each skink was to be raised in isolation. They created another group of 14 skinks where each skink was raised as part of a pair. They subjected these skinks to similar tests as the mammals were subjected to and concluded that family-lived skinks did not necessarily perform any better than isolated skinks. They concluded that this may be a result of different social environments and evolutionary needs.

Rearings' effect on family-living lizards' spatial cognition

In many animal species, rearing is important for the development of skills like spatial cognition. In this study, baby lizards were separated into two groups,  14 were raised alone and 14 were raised with one other lizard for the duration of one year. It was found that there was no difference in the spatial cognition abilities of those raised alone and those raised with a pair.

The effect of social environments on the learning ability of social lizards
Early developmental environment are often found to be important for the learning ability of various animals such as birds and mammals. However, no such research has been done for reptiles. This study was conducted on a group of social family tree skinks. The hypothesis was those raised in social isolation would be less developed than those raised socially. Young lizards were taken and raised in two groups: 1. isolation 2. in pairs. One year later, tests were conducted for the lizards of both groups. The results were quite surprising and showed that there was no difference in learning ability of the two groups. There was no difference in the success rate of the task, the number of trials, the latency to succeed, and the margin for error between the two groups. This shows that effects of social environments is not very important to the learning ability of lizards.

Does environment affect intelligence of family-living lizards
We know that environment has an effect on mammals,  including their intelligence.  But does being raised in isolation effect the intelligence of reptiles?  A study done took 14 skinks and raised them with their family, and 14 skinks raised in isolation.  After a year, the 4-part tests done report there was no significant difference between the performance of the two groups.  This demonstrates that intelligence of reptiles is not directly correlated with their upbringing environment (social or isolated).

Are lizards inhibited in learning when they are raised alone?
Mammals and birds are raised socially (with others) in order to provide them with an enriched learning environment in their younger years. These animals benefit greatly from being around others of their species and are known to be inhibited if they are isolated. However, other taxa including reptiles have not been studied enough to know how important social learning is for them. The researchers hypothesized that reptiles would have the same necessity for social learning. An experiment was done testing the effects of isolation in early years on the family-living tree skrewt. The skrewts were split into two groups, 1) isolated living, 2) in pairs. 14 of each group were raised and after a year their development was tested. It was concluded that the two groups were actually just as developed after the year, noting that isolation did not have an effect on their learning. All of the skrewts were given a task to assess their development, and it was noted that in both groups, there was no difference in the number of skrewts to complete the task, the rate at which they completed it, the number of trials for them to complete it, as well as some other important metrics. Scientists are not sure why reptiles are so different from the other species of animals in that they do not need to be raised alongside others to properly develop.

Early development isolation on congregation growth in family-living lizards
It is well known that birds and mammals have a decreased cognitive ability when their early development is done in isolation. The effect of early-year isolation is unknown on other taxa, such as reptiles. Family-living tree skinks were used to test the effect of isolated development. 14 skinks were raised isolated, while 14 were raised in pairs. After one year, a task was given to all lizards to see how they would perform. Skinks were evaluated based on the success of the task, the number of trials needed to success, the latency of success, and the number of errors . It was hypothesized that the skinks raised in isolation would perform less successfully than the skinks raised in pairs. However, all lizards performed the same, suggesting that early development does not depend on environment. This is surprising, but gives insight into the developmental process of reptiles.
