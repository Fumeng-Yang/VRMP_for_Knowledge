Cache food in presence of competitors: Are Cape Squirrels(Xerus Inauris) discriminate based on audience attentiveness?
Caching food in the presence of competitors is a subject that is often not studied. The authors studied three groups of squirrels in this experiment. The squirrels  have to cache their food near their burrow. They could do it more freely if their audience are not in line of sight or are not attentive. But when the audiences are in line of sight or are attentive, they could not cache food as freely within 10m of their burrow. Moreover, the authors have also observed a "rank effect". Which means those that higher ranked are not hesitant to cache food even in the presence of attentive audience than those who are medium or low ranked. The authors claim that squirrels would have developed this social sensitivity, depending on their competitors. The authors claim that this rank effect and social sensitivity could emphasize the fact that Squirrels do discriminate their audience based on their attentive state.

Caching in the presence of competitors
Caching food near a burrow increases the likelihood of audience observation of the caching behavior. Hence, experimenters were interested in whether caching animals took social cues into account when deciding whether and when to cache. Experimenters observed caching behavior among three groups of Cape ground squirrels in their natural habitat. Whenever an individual cached within 10m of another Cape ground squirrel, the observers made note of the attentiveness of the audience squirrel (measured by whether the caching behavior was in the direct line of sight, the proximity of the two squirrels, etc). Overall, individuals were less likely to cache if an audience squirrel was exhibiting cues suggesting attentiveness. However, observers concluded that rank had an effect on caching behavior, i.e. that high-ranking individuals were less deterred from caching in the presence of attentive potential competitors than mid- and low-ranking individuals were.

Caching in the presence of competitors: Cape ground Squirrels response to attentiveness 
Research has shown that animals are less likely to cache in the presence of competitors especially if they are attentive. Cape ground squirrels were studied to see whether there was a difference. The finding was similar to previous research. Rank effects were also found to be related to cache avoidance, where high-ranked individuals showed less avoidance in the presence of attentiveness than low-or middle ranked individuals.

Do Cape ground squirrels show avoidance to attentiveness when cashing their provisioned food?
When social animals cache their food close to their burrow, it is likely that there are audience observing their caching behaviors. And thus, it would be advantageous to social animals to be attentive to their audience when they cache their provisional food to prevent theft. In this experiment, the experimenters conduct the tasks on 3 different groups of cape ground squirrels, and record attentive behaviors (i.e. whether there is direct line eye contact and whether the squirrels stop doing anything else) and the identity of their audience. What the results show is that when the squirrels are caching their food within 10m of non-specifics, they do show attentive behaviors. Moreover, the experimenters also found that in general whether squirrels show attentive behaviors to their audience also has to do with their ranks and the audience's ranks. For instance, they found that high-ranked squirrels tend to show less attentive behaviors as compared to middle-ranked or low-ranked squirrels, which might has to do with how successful high-ranked squirrels can be in food foraging competitions. In conclusion, the experimenters conclude that cape ground squirrels do show avoidance to attentiveness, and their exact behaviors also have to do with their identities and ranks in the group.

Squirrels behavior and social attention
Squirrels were found to respond differently based on social attention. Squirrels were more likely to stash their food when not being paid attention to, than when being paid attention to.

Squirrels cache their food according to the attentiveness of who's watching
Squirrels are social animals that cache their food. This study wanted to test if squirrels cached their food based on the attentiveness of nearby squirrels who may be watching. The nearby squirrel could have been just nearby, unattentive, or could be nearby in the direct line of vision to the caching squirrel. Squirrels were more secretive when caching their food if the nearby squirrel was in direct line of vision and attentive. This indicates that squirrels can look to see which nearby squirrel is paying attention to the caching as to identify the risk of their food being stolen. High-ranked squirrels cared less about when to cache and who was attentive.

Caching behavior in Cape grey squirrels is impacted by attentiveness of the audience
Caching near the burrow imparts more danger of theft to the Cape grey squirrel, thus it is likely that Cape squirrels are attentive to the audience surrounding them when they cache food stores, and modulate their behavior accordingly. In this study, researchers observed Cape squirrels in their natural habitat. They noted the caching behavior of the Cape squirrels when conspecifics were within 10m of the caching site. The attentiveness of the conspecific audience was ranked by the researchers in terms of the orientation of their body (towards or away from the Cape squirrel), whether they had a direct line of sight, and whether or not they were engaged in some other distraction. The researchers found that the squirrels were indeed less likely to cache when an attentive audience was present. In addition, high-status squirrels were more likely to cache than low-status squirrels when audience attentiveness was held as a constant. The researchers hypothesis that this difference in behavior may be due to the relatively easier ability for more high-status squirrels to forage for and find food.

cachhing in the presence of competitors: Cape ground squirrels in the presence of an audience
To find out whether animals change their behavior in caching food, cape ground squirrels were tested. Audience members were placed 10m away, in direct line of site, or somewhat hidden, or to be seen as unattentive. The squirrels were more likely to cache their food when the audience member was seen as not being attentive. This behavior was also tested between different ranks of cape ground squirrels, and was found that the higher the ranking of the cape ground squirrel was, the less likely they were to care whether there was an active audience member or not. This is probably because lower ranking squirrels have more competition to worry about. Through this experiment, it was found that the squirrels not only could distinguish whether there was a presence nearby, but whether that presence was being attentive or not.

Awareness of audience attentiveness in Cape ground squirrels' caching behavior
When an animal caches food close to its burrow, the chance of the caching event being observed raises. To deter theft, squirrels may discriminate if other individuals nearby are attentive during caching. We tested this with squirrels caching provisioned food, and on a caching event, recorded the attentiveness (looking at or having a direct line of sight to the caching squirrel, and being occupied in other tasks) of other nearby individuals as well as their identities. We found an avoidance toward caching when the audience was attentive. We also found rank effects on this pattern: when a squirrel ranked highly it was less averse to caching in front of an attentive audience. This may be explained by higher-ranked individuals' greater ability to win in scavenging competitions.

Will caching food in the presence of a competitor have an effect based on the attentiveness of the competitor to a Cape guard squirrel?
Studies show that if a squirrel is hiding its food closer to the burrow, another squirrel is likely to see where the aforementioned squirrel hid is cache of food. trying to find out whether the cape guard squirrel takes note of the competition, and if it can tell whether or that the competitor is paying attention. done by taking note of the audience(potential competition) and whether or not they were paying attention. Found that cape guard squirrels cache more likely when the audience is inattentive rather, than when the competition is attentive.

Does audience attentiveness affect caching behavior in squirrels?
For animals that cache food in burrows close to their homes, it is beneficial to be sensitive to audience attentiveness to avoid theft of food. Three groups of a certain species of squirrel were observed with regards to their caching behavior depending on audience attentiveness (attentiveness was measured using metrics like line of sight). It was found that these squirrels were less likely to cache food when an attentive audience was present. Furthermore, higher-ranked individuals were more likely to burrow in the presence of an attentive audience, most likely

Caching and audience observation.
This study measured food caching by some raccoon species. When caching occured within 10m of other animals, it was noted whether or not those animals were paying attention according to a variety of metrics. It was found that higher ranking animals were more likely to cache while others were watching, but lower ranking animals typically waited to be isolated.

Caching in the presence of audience members: are Cape ground squirrels sensitive to attentiveness?
Caching food is an act often done in the presence of audience members. To avoid theft, it might be advantageous to cache food while audience members are inattentive. Scientists observed the caching behavior of 34 Cape ground squirrels in their natural habitat. Squirrels were watched for their caching events and when an audience member was in the area (less than 10m away), their attentiveness towards the caching event was recorded (orientation towards the caching area, lack of ongoing actions), as well as their identity. When scientists analyzed results, they found that squirrels overall preferred to cache when audience members were not attentive or present. Furthermore, caching avoidance based on audience attentiveness varied on rank; higher-ranked squirrels tended to cache in the presence of attentive audience members, while lower-ranked squirrels preferred to avoid. This might be because the lower-ranked squirrels have less resource acquisition skills and stand more risk in the event of theft. This study shows that not only can squirrels note the presence of conspecifics in the area, they also show awareness of other squirrels' attentiveness.

Caching food in front of audiences
When social animals cache food, they often do so in front of audiences. So in order to prevent theft, it would be advantageous for the animal to cache based on the attentiveness of the audiences. A set of three groups of squirrels were chosen in this experiment and tested on how they cached their food based on the attentiveness of audiences. The results showed that the squirrels tended to cache when the audience was less attentive. Additionally, rank played an effect. High ranking squirrels did not care as much about letting others see where their food is. This shows that the difference in rank could be attributed to the foraging abilities of the squirrels. Overall, the results show that social animals can recognize the attentiveness of others while caching food.

Squirrels are less likely to cache in the presence of an audience
The closer a caching animal caches to their burrow, the more likely they are to do so in the presence of an audience. For this reason it might be advantageous for animals to evolve to be aware of if there is an audience. Squirrels were observed in the presence of an audience that was looking attentively and not preoccupied with another task. Squirrels were found to be less likely to cache in the presence of an audience. Squirrel rank was found to also influence when squirrels cache: higher ranking squirrels were more likely to cache in the presence of an audience than middle and lower ranking squirrels. This suggests that squirrels may not only be attuned to the presence of an audience, but also to the ranking of nearby squirrels.

Do Cape Ground Squirrels act differently with an audience?
A study done in the natural habitat of cape ground squirrels found that when storing food in their burrow, they were attentive to who was their audience and whether they were watching the spot of food storage.  The researches defined audience as other squirrels watching within a 10m distance, whether they were in a direct line of sight, and whether or not they were busy doing something else at the time.  The resutls showed the the squirrels were less likely to cache their food when they were aware of possible competition in range watching them.  This could have to do with the animals winning competition for food storage.

Caching in the presence of competitors: Are Cape ground squirrels sensitive to audience member attentiveness?
When squirrels cache food near their home, there is high risk for competitors to witness the storage and steal the food. An experiment was done to examine how cognizant the Cape ground squirrels were of any audience members watching them cache their food. The experiment was set up by placing competitors 10 meters away from the area where they would cache their food. Several trials were done, using different social classes of squirrels and varying the attentiveness of the competitors. It was noted that the squirrels were very sensitive to the attentiveness of the competitors and were much less likely to cache the food if they were being observed. Additionally, it was concluded that the high class squirrels cared less about the attentiveness of the competitors than the medium and low class squirrels. This was probably because they are better at foraging and don't care as much if some of their cache is stolen.

Squirrels more likely to exhibit caching behaviors in the presence of non-attentive audience.
In this study, squirrels were examined with regard to their caching (or food storage) behaviors. The researchers believed that squirrels may have the propensity to cache food more frequently when its audience, such as fellow squirrels, were inattentive to its behaviors. This would reduce the likelihood of its cached food getting stolen by competitors. The study found that squirrels were able to discriminate between attentive and non-attentive audience members, and that squirrels were more likely to cache food when non-attentive audience members were present.
