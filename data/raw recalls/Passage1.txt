Dogs steal in the dark
All evidences found until now suggests that visual taking of dogs are mostly in response to stimuli rather than external social cues. An experiment had been setup where visual environments are in conflicts with social cues. A human always forbade a dog from eating a plate of food. To understand better, the experiment conducted involved illuminating various parts of the room - 1) the place of food plate 2) the human. The illumination of food plate affected the dog's behavior. It is found that dogs actually went after food much faster when in private and dark than when the food was illuminated. But when the human was illuminated the dogs response to steal the food was slightly slower. The study claims that this raises a possibility that the visual space of human could impact/affect the response of the dog.

Dogs steal food when it is dark
Behavioral studies on dogs often tend to study from the perspective of how dogs react to their visual stimuli, rather than what they take others to see. This study is interested in dogs' behaviors when there is a conflict between contextual cues and social cues. In this study, a human being constantly forbade the dog from getting the food. And in terms of the room setting, there is a constantly variation in terms of illumination, i.e. either the location where the human being is seated or where the food is placed will get lit. The results show that it is the illumination of the food, not the illumination of the human being, that affects the dog's behavior. The dog tends to steal the food whenever the food is in dark, which seems to suggest that the dog does not take into account the sight of the human being when stealing the food. However, it cannot simply be explained in terms of the simple relation between the illumination of the food and dog's stealing behavior because it is in conflict with the phenomenon that dogs also tend to steal illuminated food when it is in private. Hence, this study suggests that when stealing food, dogs do take into account the presence of human sight.

Dogs steal in the dark
It has been thought that dogs respond to social cues rather than exhibit cognitive understanding. This experiment tested this theory by contradicting social cues and understanding. The experiment  presented dogs in a room with food and an an owner sitting in a chair. Each time, the person forbade the dog from eating the food. Light would illuminate the two food or the person at various points. The study showed that they steal the food when the food is not illuminated. When the person was illuminated, that didn't stop the dogs from going towards the food. When the food was lit up and they were alone, however, they went towards the food faster. This study suggests that dogs can make a distinction of when humans can't see the food.

Dogs steal in the dark
Previous examples of visual perspective taking in dogs can be explained by other social cues or stimuli. This experiment was set up such that contextual information and social cues contradicted each other. In each trial, a human always forbade the dog to eat the food. The experiment then varied points of illumination, i.e. illuminating either the food or the human present in the trial. The experiment concluded that the dog stole the food more often in the dark. The site of illumination was critical in determining the dog's behavior: a difference was observed in the dog's behavior only if the food was lit or dark, with the dog stealing the food more often if the food was not lit. This cannot be explained by the mere presence of the human, because the dog exhibited no difference in behavior if the human was lit or not. Nor was the dog generally deterred from the food if it was lit, because the dog would approach lit food much more quickly than unlit food in private. The results of the experiment suggest that the dog took the human's visual access to the food into consideration when deciding whether to steal.

Dogs are more likely to steal in the dark
In an experiment in which a dog was placed near a human who owned some food, the dog was more likely to steal the food when it was dark. Their likelihood to steal also correlated with amount of illumination. This was based on the illumination of the food, not of the human.

Dogs steal food in the dark
The behavior of dogs is usually studied in relation to its reaction to external stimulus rather than their understanding of others' perception. In this current study, dogs were repeatedly told by a human not to take food. When the lighting situation changed, dogs stole the food much more frequently under low-light conditions. In addition, the type of lighting would change; sometimes the food only was illuminated, other times the human was illuminated. Whether the food was lit or unlit had the biggest affect on the dogs' behavior, suggesting that the dogs made the decision based on whether the food itself was visible to the human, rather than whether the human was there to watch.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Doggies!
Researchers tested to see if dogs' actions were prompted by external stimuli or internal cognition by examining the rate of theft committed during varied levels of illuminated spaces. The dogs were placed with human who discouraged the dogs from eating the food. Then trials were held where the humans were in low illuminated lighting or the food was, to varying degrees, while the dogs were left to their own devices. Researchers found that dogs did examine if they were insight of humans before stealing food, even when lowly lit. Researchers concluded that their findings supported that dogs used internal cognition when approaching situations.

Dogs steal food in the dark
All current evidence in dogs' use of visual information in behavior choice can be explained by a model in which the dogs react to visual stimuli, without taking into consideration the information that others possess. We tested whether dogs chose to steal food in a room in which a human always forbade the dog from taking the food. What varied was the pattern of lighting in the room, which would sometimes illuminate mainly the human, sometimes mainly the food, and included other variables such as whether the light was focused or dispersed around the room. The dogs seemed to take into consideration whether the human was illuminated strongly. Additionally, the dogs' choices could not be explained by the low-level rule of avoiding illuminated food, which they approached faster than non-illuminated food when in private. So we conclude that in light of the current finding it is possible that the dogs modeled the information available to the human to some extent when choosing whether or not to take the food.

Dogs steal more often in the dark.
The authors of the study set up a room to be illuminated differently to see how dogs react to different scenarios. The same room would have one human and some food, and there were complex social cues so that the human would condition the dogs to believe that they were always being denied food. This must have created the incentive to steal. In dim lighting, the dogs responded quite differently. Whenever the food was illuminated, dogs reacted differently. The authors felt that this difference was positive (the dogs accessed food, presumably) and that this difference did not confirm the belief that brightly illuminated food may be less appetizing to dogs. Similarly, surprisingly, only illuminating the human also did not prevent dogs from stealing. The authors concluded that the dogs don't view the human as a threat to the food source, but that they probably see it as a controller given visual access to the food source. So when the food is in the dark, they probably assume that the human doesn't have visual access to it and therefore must not control it. This is why there are greater rates of stealing.

Dogs steal in the dark
Previous studies done on dogs and visual perception have not clarified whether dogs simply respond to certain stimulus or whether they account for the visual access and responses of others. This study attempted to investigate this by presenting a situation where social cues and visual cues conflict. A human forbid the dog from taking food. Then the human and dog were placed in a room and the lighting in the room was varied: sometimes the human was illuminated, and other times the food was illuminated. Dogs stole more food in the dark. When the food was illuminated, the dogs stole less food, but their stealing was not affected when the human was illuminated. This shows that the presence of the human did not prevent the dog from stealing food. But the illumination of the food affected the dog, and cannot be merely explained by a simple avoidance of illuminated food in general, because the dogs stole illuminated food faster in private. This study suggests that dogs may take into account the visual access of humans when stealing.

Dogs steal in the Dark

Dogs Steal In The Dark
When presented with food and told not to take it by a human, differences in illumination affect dogs behavior, according to this study. When the food was illuminated and the human was not, but the human told them not to take it, the dogs did not take the food. However when the human was illuminated but the food was not, the dogs took the food. This suggests that dogs have an awareness of the human's ability to see the food and guide their actions based on that.

Dogs steal in the dark
There is currently no dog behavior that cannot be explained by response to context. In this experiment, dogs are presented with a circumstance in which context clues and social cues are in conflict. Humans always forbid dogs from stealing food. Dogs are placed in an environment where lighting is varied - one where the human is illuminated, and one where the food is illuminated. Dogs were more likely to steal food when the food was not illuminated, showing that dogs respond to their expectations of the human's sight of the food. Dogs were not less likely to steal food when the human was illuminated, showing that they don't take sight of the human as a sign to not steal food. This also is not a consequence of dogs being less likely to take illuminated food in general, as other tests have shown that dogs are more likely to take illuminated food most of the time.

Dogs steal more in the night
After humans told dogs not to take food in a room, researchers examined how much food a dog would take relative to the lighting of the room.  They found that dogs steal more when the side of the room that's lit up has a human sitting in a chair and the dark side has the food.  It also depended on the the type of light that was being shined down.  For example, whether the light was around the food or directly on the human and so on.

Dogs steal in the dark
An experiment was done where dogs were put in a room with a human and food. They were told not to eat the food by the humans. Different trials were done to see when the dogs would listen depending on the variety of lighting and where the light was focused. Some conclusions included the fact that the dogs were more likely to steal the food when there wasn't light aimed at the food, but they didn't care as much when the light was focused on the humans. The main conclusion from this experiment was that dogs took into consideration human visual abilities when deciding whether or not to steal food, since when the food wasn't illuminated they were more likely to take it.

Dogs Steal in the Dark
It has been suggested that visual perception taking in dogs is possibly due to stimuli and not context. To test this, dogs were trained to a task where the context and instruction were in conflict. An owner never allowed dogs to eat food. Then, the location of the light source was varied. For example, sometimes the area where the human was sitting was lit and other times the area with the food was lit. Dogs were more likely to take forbidden food when the environment was dark. Having the food be lit did not dissuade the dog from stealing. Additionally, having the human be lit changed the behavior of the dog. This cannot be explained by low level association theory that dogs were less likely to take lit food, for dogs rushed faster to lit food in private. Thus, it is possible that the dogs' decision to steal food is based on the human's visual access to the food.
