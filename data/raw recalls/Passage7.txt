Can bottlenose dolphins cooperate when solving novel problems?
Cooperative behavior in dolphins have been observed in nature, including tasks such as mate acquisition and play. However, there have not been extensive studies conducted in a controlled environment. In this study, six dolphins were given the opportunity to engage in cooperative problem-solving without the training or instruction of experimenters. Two adult male dolphins repeatedly and spontaneously cooperated to open a can of fish, which required pulling in opposite directions on a string to open the can. They displayed no aggression during the task and both dolphins partook in eating the fish, continuing to interact non-aggressively with the object after the fish were eaten. The four other dolphins may have also successfully performed the task, but may have relinquished their investment due to the interest of the two socially dominant males.

Can bottlenose dolphins perform cooperative tasks?
Previous research on cetacean species has observed cooperative behavior in foraging, mate acquisition, play, and epelimatic behavior. However, cooperative behavior among dolphins has been more difficult to observe in controlled settings. In this experiment, six dolphins were given the opportunity to perform a task that would be easier to succeed in completing if they cooperated. Two adult male dolphins consistently cooperated to open a chest containing fish by pulling ropes on either side of the chest. The task was deemed cooperative because the dolphins had to pull in opposite directions to open the chest on one side. The dolphins exhibited no aggressive behavior when performing the task, and both of the dolphins ate the fish. The two dolphins also exhibited non-aggressive synchronized behavior with the chest after the fish had been eaten. The other dolphins may have been willing and able to cooperate to complete the task, but the two dolphins who completed the task were dominant adult males, which meant that the dominant males' interest in the task may have deterred the other dolphins from attempting it.

Can bottlenose dolphins cooperate when performing a novel task?
Cooperative behaviors are often observed in social animals, including those observed in mate acquisition, food searching and etc. However, less is known about their cooperative behaviors in more controlled settings. And thus in this experiment, the experimenters are interested in learning whether bottlenose dolphins show cooperative behaviors when solving a novel task without human intervention. This experiment is conducted on 6 bottlenose dolphins, and can be most efficiently done if the dolphins cooperate with each other. What the results show is that within the 6 dolphins, when the experiment is in progress, there are 2 male dolphins simultaneously pulling the respective ends of a rope to open the lid of a container where there lies a fish, which is clearly a sign of cooperative behavior. Moreover, when they both pull the respective ends of the rope, there is no sign of aggressiveness from both the male dolphins. Even after they successfully open the container and finished consuming their food, there is still no sign of any aggressive behaviors from both of them towards each other. Though in the experiments, only the 2 male dolphins show cooperative behaviors, the experimenters suggest that it does not necessarily mean that the rest are unable to perform the task cooperatively: it is more likely due to the case that the identity of the 2 male dolphins, i.e. they are the dominant members, preclude other dolphins from performing the tasks.

Do bottleneck dolphins show cooperation for novel tasks
The study wanted to evaluate whether dolphins show cooperation when given a novel task. 6 dolphins were given a novel task to solve without human intervention or training. 2 of the dolphins showed signs of cooperation by pulling on their respective ropes to open a container of food. After opening it they both consumed the food that was in it. The two dolphins were dominant males who showed cooperation, and the other 4 dolphins may have showed cooperation but might have been precluded from taking part by the 2 dolphins who were with the container.

Male dolphins show cooperation to retrieve food
Cooperation has been seen by dolphin species in nature but is hard to witness in a more controlled setting. 6 dolphins were trained to undergo a cooperation task where they had to open a jar of food by pulling on ropes in the opposite direction. The two dominant male dolphins successfully completed the task with non-aggressive behavior and shared to food with each other. They even used  the jar afterwards in non-aggressive behavior. The other dolphins didn't participate because it was the dominant male dolphins who led the task.

Cooperation between bottlenose dolphins in a novel task
Cooperative behavior between dolphins in the wild centering around tasks such as foraging, mate acquisition, play, and epimeletic behavior has been well-documented. These researchers set out to see if adult bottlenose dolphins were able to cooperate on a novel task. Six dolphins were given the opportunity to cooperate on a task that would be more easily accomplished with cooperation. Two adult males quickly collaborated on the task, each taking hold of a string to pull apart a can with food inside. The dolphins displayed no aggression while working on the task, nor while eating the food after the can had been successfully opened. They also engaged in cooperative behavior resembling play with the can afterwards. It is possible that the other four dolphins would have join in on the cooperative task, but the two dolphins who engaged in the task were alpha males and this may have discouraged the other dolphins from joining. Overall, this study shows that dolphins can indeed cooperate non-aggressively on a novel task.

dolphins learn to cooperate on novel tasks
It is said that some animals are able to cooperate on novel tasks. To test this, a pack of six dolphins were given a task and no instructions from the outside on how to solve it. Two dolphins cooperated with each other and pulled the strings on either side, opening the box and revealing the treats. The two dolphins shared the treats and did not show any aggressive behavior to one another or to the treat container after the treat was consumed. It can be assumed that dolphins being highly social creatures understand cooperation and are able to apply it in a novel task. As to why only the two dolphins cooperated, it could be said that they were the two dominant males of the pack and hence took on the challenge.

Team Dolphin
Experimenters tested to see if dolphins exhibited cooperative ability. Using 6 dolphins, experimenters gave the dolphins a jar with a fish inside. They observed that two dominant males were able to cooperatively open the jar, retrieve the fish, and then share the fish evenly. Meanwhile the remaining 4 dolphins did not participate, likely due to the dominant males being active. Researchers concluded that their experiment supported that dolphins could perform cooperative skill tasks together.

Can bottlenose dolphins learn a novel cooperative task?
Dolphins have been observed engaging in a variety of cooperative tasks. However, observing them in controlled conditions is difficult. Researchers observed six dolphins. The dolphins were presented with a task which required cooperation (opening a jar by pulling two ropes in opposite directions). A pair of male dolphins were observed cooperating significantly, and they succeeded in opening the jar. While cooperating, they did not act aggressively, and they shared the fish in the jar. Additionally, they continued to interact cooperatively with the empty jar. The other dolphins did not interact, but this may be because the two males were dominant males and the other dolphins were reluctant to get involved after the males had taken interest in the task.

Dolphins coordinate to perform cooperative tasks
Cooperation has already been observed in cetaceans, but we tested careful coordination with six dolphins in a scenario with a box containing food that could be most easily opened through coordinated cooperation, with no human intervention or training. Two dominant male dolphins spontaneously pulled on ropes on different sides of the box in opposite directions, leading the box to open. This was  considered coordination because of the orientation of their pulling behavior, the lack of aggression during the opening process, and the fact that they engaged in nonaggressive coordinated behavior involving the box after it had been opened. It is possible that the other four dolphins would have cooperated, but the interest of the dominant males in the box seemed to preclude this.

Do bottlenose dolphins cooperate for foraging efforts?
The authors of the study have general interest in whether different kinds of mammals cooperate for survival tasks, such as foraging. They subjected a group of six dolphins to see how they would perform on a task (without human interference) where they would need to cooperate to solve the task. There were two dominant male dolphins in the group, and the authors observed that these two males cooperated, and possibly precluded the other four from participation because of their status (but this cannot be confirmed). The two dominant males were definitely cooperating with each other, as they were tasked with releasing food from a barrel that was tied with rope, and the dolphins pulled in opposite directions, collectively, to ensure that the lid on the barrel was released. Following this, both dolphins ate the food, were non-aggressive to each other, and engaged with the container that had stored the food while the others held back. There may be some social dynamic in the group.

Can bottlenose dolphins cooperate to solve a problem?
Scientists have observed many situations where cetaceous animals cooperate to complete tasks like mate acquisition, play, and resource acquisition. However, there haven't been many studies done in controlled settings. In this study, a group of bottlenose dolphins were tested to see if they demonstrated cooperation while given a problem. Six bottlenose dolphins were given a task. Two male dolphins repeatedly and spontaneously interacted cooperatively to open a container of fish, pulling on ropes in opposite directions in order to open the container at one end and release the fish. This behavior was cooperative because the dolphins pulled the rope simultaneously at opposite ends. The dolphins were not aggressive towards each other while cooperating, and both dolphins ate the fish after it was released. They also synchronously and non-aggressively interacted with the container after it was opened. It's possible that the four other dolphins would have interacted cooperatively to open the container, but their interaction was precluded by the interest of the two males, who were both dominant males.

Can bottlenose dolphins cooperate to perform a novel task?
Dolphins have been known to cooperate in natural settings to forage, find mates or play, but cooperation in controlled settings has been less observed. To study cooperation under controlled conditions, six bottlenose dolphins were presented with the opportunity to perform a cooperative task with no human intervention or training. Two male dolphins were able to cooperate to open a container containing food. The behavior was seen as cooperative because the dolphins pulled two ropes in opposite directions. The two males then consumed the food without displaying aggressive behavior towards each other, and they also explored the container in a synchronized and non-aggressive manner. The remainder of the dolphins in the group might have also cooperated to solve the task, but the two male dolphins were dominant males and their interest in the apparatus might have prevented the others from participating.

Can Bottlenose Dolphins successfully collaborate on an untrained task
6 bottlenose dolphins were set up to perform a pulling task in order to obtain food. Two male dolphins collaborated to pull both sides and open the package with food in it, which they later shares. The other four did not participate, likely because these dominant males had already taken all of the necessary roles in performing this task.

Cooperation in Bottlenose Dolphins
Many instances of cooperation can be observed in dolphins, but it can be hard to make this assessment in confined spaces. Six dolphins were given the opportunity to cooperate on a task that would be easy if the dolphins worked together. Two male dolphins cooperated on the task and successfully completed the task. The act was cooperative because each dolphin pulled on a rope in a different direction, opening a container. The dolphins then proceeded to eat the food inside the container together, then engaged in non-food-related activity using the empty container. The remaining four dolphins may have participated, but since the two males were the alpha males, they may have taken over the situation.

Can bottlenose dolphins work together to solve a problem?
This experiment looked at how dolphins were or were not able to collaborate to complete a task. While teamwork has often been observed with this species, this behavior has proved difficult to test in a controlled setting. Six dolphins were involved in this experiment, and their task was to open a container containing fish. The process of opening this container was intentionally designed to be easier if more than one dolphin was involved. Two of the dolphins, the dominant males, repeatedly worked together to open containers, and then shared the fish. Their behavior was not aggressive, and they both interacted with the container after opening it and eating the fish. It is possible that the other dolphins would have collaborated as well, but maybe stemming from the fact that the two dominant males were clearly interested and engaged in this activity, their interest was reduced.

Can dolphins cooperate?
Experimenters put 6 dolphin in a tank and created a task that would be easier if they cooperated.  Two dolphins demonstrated cooperation by pulling on opposite ends of a string to open up a tank full of fish.  They didn't show any aggression toward one another and ate the fish when they came in.  They think the other 4 dolphin would've helped out, but the two that did the task were alpha males and dominated the group.

Can bottlenose dolphins cooperate when solving a novel task?
Cooperation in bottlenose dolphins is observed everywhere in nature, especially with mating, foraging, and play. However, it has been difficult for scientists to replicated this behavior in a lab setting. Six dolphins were given a task that would best be solved by cooperating. They were put in a room without any training or human interaction. Two adult male dolphins consistently and synchronously cooperated together to complete the task. The cooperation involved simultaneously pulling ropes on either side of a container that was holding fish in for the dolphins to eat. When they opened the container together, the two dolphins ate all of the fish equally. Additionally after the task was done they played in the container together (performed non-aggressive interaction with the container). It is thought that the rest of the dolphins would have cooperated too, but the two that did were the most dominant of the group and were the ones to take charge.

Dolphins - Can they complete a novel task cooperatively? 
Dolphins, though clearly intelligent, were tested to see whether or not they were capable of solving a novice task together. Through a lever-based cooperative "novice" task, two adult male dolphins took charge and communicated effectively enough to escape the area. Though there were four other dolphins present that were capable of cooperating, the dominance exerted by the two male dolphins who took charge prevented any further assistance.

Cooperative behaviour in dolphins.
The study involved determining the extent to which dolphins are able to engage in cooperative behaviour. Previous research and empirical observations noted that dolphins exhibited cooperative behaviour in contexts such as foraging, playing and mating behaviours. In this experiment, 6 dolphins were placed in an enclosure, with a pair of dolphins assigned to opposite ends of a box with a rope strung through it. This task required the dolphins to collaborate explicitly in order to earn the payoff. Each dolphin had to grab the respective end of the rope and pull in opposite directions for the food to be released. The first pair of dolphins managed to do so, and even collaboratively shared the food and displayed non-synchronous behaviours with the box. It is possible that the other four dolphins may have exhibited similar behaviours. However, they did not approach the box, likely because the first two dolphins were alpha males.
