Visual discrimination of 3D rotated objects - Fishes (Malawick) have form constancy
Fishes swim often in three dimensional environment like ocean. They need to be able to visually discriminate objects in order to survive in such an environment. The authors went ahead with an experiment to prove the same. The authors made the fish swim surrounded by plastic animals like frog, etc, rotating it by 45' first and then by 90'. Each time the fishes could discriminate between them. Even  when they rotated 180' from front to back or side by side, or increased/reduced the size by 10%, they were able to discriminate the 3D object animals. Hence, the authors claim that fishes have a cognitive social awareness of visual representation of 3D objects around them using which they are able to discriminate the 3D rotated objects, based on form and shape. The authors call it form constancy. Hence, malawick are cognitive of form constancy.

Visual discrimination in Malawa Cichlids: form constancy study
In a wild environment, it would be advantageous for animals to be able to recognize the particular form or shape of other objects or animals despite their constant changes or variations in orientation or color or even size. This study aims to study form constancy in 8 different Malawa Cichilid, i.e. whether these fish are able to recognize the constant form or structure of particular objects or animals. In order study form constancy, different animals models are being used. In the experimental setting, different animal models are rotated in the same plane same space by 45 degree or 90 degree, or even 180 degree (which means back to the front or vice versa). Out of the 8 different individuals, 7 of them are able to successfully perform the tasks. Results show that these fish are able to pick up the particular forms or structures of those animal models. Moreover, the study also find that malawa cichilids have the ability to categorize their visual stimuli: for a certain type of frog models, these fish are able to recognize their forms independently from their colors and sizes. And thus the study concludes that form constancy is present in malawa cichilids. Such an ability is also crucial for animal survival because they can be employed in food foraging and such.

Visual discrimination of 3D objects in Malawi ciclids: a first indication of form constancy
Fish swim in a 3D environment, so being able to discriminate objects from the front, side, and behind is important. This study examined the ability for Malawi ciclids to determine 3D objects using plastic animals. The objects were placed at 45, 90, and even at times 180 degrees to see how the Malawi ciclids would respond. Apart from one individual case, the ciclids were able to recognize all of the items successfully. They were even able to make category distinctions, noticing a turtle regardless of minor shape, color, and size variation. This is the first study to suggest that these fish are capable of determining form constancy. This is an important trait to have, to be able to navigate, watch out for predators, and orient themselves in their habitat.

Visual discrimination of rotated 3D objects in Malawai Cichlids 
For species living in environments with several 3 dimensional objects, it is important to be able to recognize and differentiate between objects of different shapes, colour and sizes especially since it helps in foraging, orienting in habitats, recognizing predators, etc. It is also important for them to be able to recognize the objects even if it is presented from different angles and sides. The aim of the study was to see whether Eight fish were shown several fake animal models that were rotated on a plane by 45 and 90 degrees, and one was rotated by 180 degrees. All fish were generally able to recognize the models even when presented differently, except for one case.

Visual discrimination of 3-D objects in Malawi cichlids
Fish move in a 3 dimensional environments with objects of various shapes, colors and sizes around them. Hence, a study examined whether the fish were able to distinguish between objects that were rotated at 45, 90 and 180 degrees. Fish were generally able to categorize the objects successfully, a finding that is important to species of the kind especially for helping in foraging, mating, habitat finding and living in their surrounding.

Fish Vision
Fish live a in 3-dimensional environment where the ability to recognize the same structure from different degrees of position is important. Researchers tested to see if (I forget the fish) could accurately identify experimental models in a underwater environment. The test proved positive in that the subjects were to be able to qualify different test models from different angles, at a 45 degree or 180 degree orientation, and even separately register said models as different creatures like frogs and turtles.

Object recognition under 3d rotation in cichlids: a first indication of object persistence in fishes
Fish live in and navigate a 3D environment. Researchers studied whether they recognized objects under 3d rotations (of 45, 90, and 180 degrees). This testing utilized a choice-based experiment. After training, all but one of the fish were able to complete all of the tests, indicating recognition that the objects were the same after rotation. Additionally, the fish were able to categorize similar objects (such as different colored turtles). This activity makes sense given that these fish would need to be able to perform similar tasks in the wild in order to categorize and recognize food, other fish of their species, and other animals. This result indicates the persistence of objects for this species of fish, and suggests that the same is likely true for fish in general.

Recognition of rotated 3D shapes in a fish species, the first evidence of form constancy in fish
Fish move in a three-dimensional environment in which it is important to be able to recognize objects from different angles for reasons such as avoiding predators, acquiring food, and associating with conspecifics. We tested such recognition ability in a fish species using plastic animal figurines. After successful training, each experiment presented several animal figurines rotated in the plane or in space by 45 and 90 degrees. One additional experiment rotated them 180 degrees, i.e. back-to-front. In all cases but one the fish successfully completed the experimental tasks. This recall is evidence for form constancy in the species. Furthermore the fish seemed to be able to categorize stimuli, and recognized figurines despite differences in color and minor differences in form.

Cape squirrels cache food differently depending upon audience attentiveness.
Three clusters of Cape squirrels were tested on the way and the speed with which they cache food depending on the audiences present, and the audiences' degree of attentiveness towards the squirrels' activities. It was observed that Cape squirrels had an understanding or awareness of the degree of attentiveness with which their activities were being viewed, so that the presence of an audience member itself wasn't a deterrent. The identities of different audience members were also recorded to register differences in deterrence. An added observation was that even when there is a high degree of attentiveness, certain squirrels do not disengage from caching food. This was attributed to differences in rank in the squirrels, so that the squirrels that were presumed to be high-ranking were less likely to be deterred by spectators. The authors of the study seemed to infer that squirrels' relative rank must be derived as a measure of strength, and that these ranks must be determined from results of squirrel foraging competitions.

Identification of differently-oriented shapes by Malawi cichlids - form constancy in fish
Since fish live in a three-dimensional world, they require the ability to distinguish and recognize objects with different three-dimensional orientations. A variety of plastic animal models were presented in choice tests to Malawi cichlids. Once these fish were trained, these models were presented after rotation in the same plane as well as 45-degree and 90-degree rotations in three dimensions in transfer tests. With the exception of one individual, all the fish were able to complete tasks involving the recognition of the animal models. Fish were also able to recognize models rotated by 180-degrees. Moreover, the cichlids were able to categorize models based on shape - they were able to recognize frog and turtle models independent of size and color. This is a first indicator of form constancy among fish. This ability would be important to recognize predators in different orientations as well as identify territorial information.

Visual discrimination of 3D objects for Malawi cichlids: a first indicator for form constancy in fishes
Fish have to navigate a 3D environment and thus benefit by being able to discriminate forms based on shape, sound, and color. It is also advantageous to recognize the same shape when approached from a different angle, e.g. from front-to-side or front-to-back. This study examined the form constancy ability of Malawi cichlids. Eight fishes were tested in their recognition of various plastic animal models of differing shape, size, and color. All models were shown in two experiments. The fish were then tested in their ability to recognize shapes when turned 45 and 90 degrees to the side or the front. In one experiment the models were turned 180 degrees, front-to-back. The fish acquired recognition ability quickly, and all but one fish successfully completed the test with the turned models. This is the first study suggesting that fish can recognize form constancy. The fish also showed abilities to categorize forms, showing recognition of turtle and frog models regardless of size and color and specific shape. More studies should be done on form recognition in fishes, as this is an important adaptation that can help fish acquire resources, avoid predators, and find conspecifics, as well as orient in their habitat and terrain.

Malawi Cichlin fish recognizing objects in 3D space demonstrate shape constancy
Fish need to be able to navigate in 3D space, so this experiment tested if fish were able to recognize shapes from different angles. After completing training, fish were shown plastic animals (in their same plane) rotated at 45 or 90 degrees (and some were rotated 180 degrees, so back-to-front). They were able to recognize these plastic animals from different angles. Additionally, the fish proved able to categorize: they demonstrated shape constancy by being able to recognize objects that resembled turtles or frogs despite slight differences in color or shape.

recognition of 3d objects in clichlids: form constancy
The ability to recognize objects that have been rotated is very important to animals. In this study, fish were first trained. Then, they were given various plastic objects that had been rotated. The fish did very well in passing all of these tests, with one exception. They even recognized objects that had their colors changed and forms altered. This shows that these fish have the ability to recognize objects from many angles. It is an important trait for them that they probably utilize during foraging, swimming, and other activities.

Do Malawi Chichids understand 3d objects?
Fish live in a 3d environment that requires them to discern objects based on form, size and shape. This experiment used plastic models and rotations of the plastic models at 45 and 90 degrees to test the ability of fish to discern and interact with objects. It was found that all fish in the study except one passed the test, attesting to the presence of skills to interpret 3d objects in fish

Malani fish recognizing rotated objects
In the wild, it is important to be able to recognize the same feature from multiple angles. Fish were trained to complete a task involving recognizing small plastic animal figurines in a tank, then those objects were rotated by 45 and 90 degrees. In one study the objects were rotated by 180 degrees, indicating a complete turnaround of the object. In all but one case, the fish were able to complete the task. Furthermore, fish were able to respond to the presence of predators and avoid them. This skill would be very useful in the wild, where fish can use it for foraging and evading predators.

3D visual discrimination in Malawi cichlids: a first look at form constancy in fish
Fish live in an environment for which it is vital for them to recognize different stimuli based on color, texture, and size. However, little experimentation has been done to see if they can easily determine that objects are the same when they are rotated (but have the same form). An experiment was done with eight Malawi cichlids in which the fish were shown different plastic models of fish rotated between 45 and 90 degrees. They were successful in realizing that the models were the same, despite being rotated. Another experiment was repeated in which the fish were now flipped upside down (180 degrees), and they were still successful. Additionally, the fish were effective at determining the sameness of stimuli using turtle and other fish models with various rotations. The results of this experiment show that fish are good at observing form constancy.

Malawi cochlids discriminating differently-oriented 3D objects: evidence of form constancy in fish.
In this experiment, Malawi cochlid fish were tested for their ability to discriminate 3D objects with different orientations. 8 Malawi cochlids were placed in environments with differently-oriented 3D objects, with some of the objects rotated to the front and back by 45 and 90 degrees, as well as to the left and right, and with one trial even featuring a full 180 degree rotation. The objects were plastic animal figures in the shape of animals such as turtles. The experiment found that Malawi cochlids were able to discriminate the objects and navigate regardless of color or texture, which proves a behavior that is useful for hunting, escaping from predators, conspecifics and other natural applications.

Visual 3d representation in malawi Cichlad: a first suggestion of form constancy in fish
Fish live in a 3D environment. Thus, it is helpful to be able to differentiate objects by size, shape, and color. It is also helpful to be able to recognize a shape when moving around it, say back to front or front to side. In this experiment, 8 fish were trained to a task using plastic models. Then, the models were changed in the same plane, rotating 45 or 90 degrees. In one trial, the model was rotated 180 degrees (i.e. front to back). In all but one case, the fish were able to successfully complete tasks. Additionally, there fish had some categorization ability. They recognized plastic models of turtles and frogs even when color and shape were modified. This suggests that fish have form constancy and categorization abilities which are helpful for activities like foraging and identifying a predator, as well as recognizing one's environment.
