Asian Elephants acquire resources by blowing
Asian Elephants in Kamine Zoo, Japan acquire food by blowing with their trunk. While other animals use sticks or other resources, these elephants use their trunks. They were seen blowing their food to get it closer to them. Once it reached a certain distance, they would stop blowing and retrieve it. Elephants used different blow strengths based on how close or far away the food was, which suggests that elephants have a sophisticated grasp of what their blowing methods can achieve. They usually use blowing for things like communication.

Elephants blow on food to reach it
Elephants, unlike any other animals, were found to sometimes blow on food that was out of reach, in order to get to it.

Asian elephants blow to reach inaccessible food
Animals have been observed acquiring inaccessible food by using sticks or occasionally water. One exception is when elephants use manipulated airflow through their trunk to acquire food from an inaccessible location. Two female Asian elephants at Kamine Zoo, Japan were observed to do this. Experimenters strategically placed food in inaccessible locations around the habitat, and the elephants adjusted the airflow in their trunks to get the food. One subject would adjust the length of her blowing based on the distance of the food object, suggesting that elephants can fine-tune this strategy. This makes sense because trunks play a big part in the social habits and functional aspects of an elephant's life.

Zoo elephants blow their trunks to obtain items that are otherwise inaccessible
Many animals use sticks or water to obtain items/food that are otherwise inaccessible. This study wanted to see if two Asian zoo elephants in Japan would blow air from their trunks to move objects so that they are more accessible. These two elephants were able to blow air from their trunks and blew more air for objects that were further away. One elephant was better than the other.

Asian elephants acquire inaccessible food by blowing
Many species of animals acquire otherwise inaccessible food with the aid of sticks or occasionally water. However, elephants have been documented to manipulate breathing air to bring inaccessible food into range. The researchers observed two female Asian elephants at Kamine Zoo in Japan by placing food in inaccessible areas. The elephants blew air through their trunks to bring the food into a range they could access. They modulated the amount they blew based on distance to the food (they were more likely to blow the food if it was further away, within their range). One elephant modified the duration she blew by how far away the food was from herself. Overall, these elephants demonstrate adaptive techniques to bring otherwise inaccessible food into a range that they could access. It is likely that this finding of using blowing the retrieve food is unique to elephants; they are more adept at manipulating air because of their long, dexterous trunks and certain natural habits such as blowing air to communicate with other elephants and comfort themselves.

Elephants Blow
Researches tested to see if elephants in a Japanese zoo used air blowing from their trunks as tools for acquiring difficult to reach food. Both elephants were observed using air blown form their trunks to move food closer to them, and then reduce the amount of air as the food got closer. Considering that elephants already utilize their trunks for other complex activities this new observation provides more insights into elephant habits.

Asian elephants obtain inaccessible food by blowing
Many animals have been observed using tools and water to obtain inaccessible food. Elephants in a zoo were observed using blowing to do the same. The authors studied these elephants by placing inaccessible food at different distances from the elephants. They were seen using blowing to get to the food, and one was observed blowing at different strengths depending on the distance to the food. This behavior makes sense and is probably unique to the species given elephants' prehensile trunks and their existing use of them for self comfort and communication.

Asian elephants blow to acquire inaccessible food
Many species are able to acquire otherwise inaccessible food with the use of sticks or occasionally water. We present the first evidence of this behavior through blowing air in female Asian elephants. The tests were  conducted at a zoo in Japan, where researchers placed food in several inaccessible locations; elephants blew on the food in a directed way: one matched the intensity of her blowing to the food distance, blowing more when the food was farther away and less when it was closer. In this way she not only blew to move the food but fine-tuned its position for easy grasping. This use of blowing air is likely unique to elephants, with their dexterous trunks and familiarity with the task of blowing, which they use for self-comfort and to vocalize.

Asian Elephants blow with their trunks in order to obtain inaccessible food.
Animals use objects like sticks or water in order to obtain inaccessible food. For elephants, they can use their trunk and generate an airflow. Study showed two Asian elephants--> placed inaccessible objects near them, observed response. When the objects were farther away, the elephants  blew for longer periods of time, than when the objects were closer and within reach. the dexterity and use of their muscles in their trunks affords Asian Elephants this advantage.

Asian elephants blow to obtain food
Various species of animals use water and tools like sticks to procure food, but blowing as a means of physically obtaining food has not been observed. Food was deliberately placed in hard-to-reach places at Kamine Zoo in Japan to test the strategies used by female elephants to obtain it. It was observed that elephants blew to make the food easier to reach. The duration of blowing was also determined by the distance between the elephants and the food - the farther away the food, the longer the elephants blew. This indicates that elephants blow not only to reach the food but also position it for easier grasping. Personal differences in blowing duration and strategy, causing differing efficiencies of obtaining food, were also noted. This illustrates a new mode of spontaneous behavior used by animals to obtain food. Blowing is known to be used by elephants primarily for self-comfort and acoustic communication.

Elephants acquire inaccessible food by blowing
Many animals have been observed using materials like sticks and water to get closer to food. Some elephants have also been observed manipulating breathing through their trunks to move resources. Two female Asian elephants at Kamine Zoo in Japan were studied and their blowing behaviors are reported here. Researchers placed food in inaccessible areas. The elephants then used blowing to manipulate the food until it was within an accessible range. One elephant was observed altering the duration of her blowing based on the distance of the food (the farther the food, the longer the blowing duration). This study shows that elephants not only use manipulated breathing to acquire food but also to achieve goals, like getting the food closer. Usage of blowing also varies based on individual elephants. This study records a new resource-acquisition behavior in elephants. Elephants are possibly the only mammal to use blowing as a resource acquisition behavior because they are well-accustomed to using their dextrous trunks to achieve goals, like self-comfort and acoustic communication.

Elephants use blowing in food acquisition
Elephants have been known to use tools such as sticks or even water when acquiring food. Two individual elephants in Japan were chosen for study. Both used blowing to bring food that was out of reach closer. They also adjusted the strength of breath relative to the distance to the food. This shows that not only do elephants use blowing, but fine-tune their blowing. This behavior is likely unique to elephants, because of their long dexterous trunk and familiarity with using it social and for vocalizing.

Asian elephants using blowing techniques to obtain otherwise inaccessible food.
It has been shown that animals can use sticks and water to obtain food, but this experiment shows that blowing (the control of breath) should also be considered another method. This experiment involved two female Asian elephants in Japan. Food was placed out of reach, and the elephants' responses to this were observed. The females demonstrated their ability to obtain the food by blowing controlled breaths through their trunks. It was shown that they altered the amount of breath they used based on their distance from the food (more breath if it was farther away, and less if it was closer). Additionally, this experiment showed that not only do elephants use this method to obtain inaccessible food, but they also use it to situate food in specific places optimal for grasping. Therefore, blowing should be considered another technique by which animals obtain food.

Elephants use blowing as a tool for retrieving food.
Elephants in domestication and wild environments have been observed to use a variety of methods, such as water, to retrieve their food. This study sought to evaluate the use of blowing as a tool for food retrieval. In this experiment, Asian elephants in a Japanese zoo were placed in a setting where they could use blowing to retrieve their food. The study found not only that they did so, but that they also varied the level and duration of their blowing in accordance with the proximity of the food to themselves. Elephants who were closer to the food reduced the duration and strength of their blowing. This experiment proves the premise, that elephants use blowing as a tool for food retrieval.

Elephants use Air through Trunk to Reach Inaccessible Food
Studies showed that elephants were capable of manipulating how they breathed through their trunks in order to reach certain foods. The distance from food to trunk played a significant part: in the experiment conducted to analyze this, the elephants increased the strength of air flow through their trunks in order to reach or gain access to food that was farther away. The exact level of how strong the air would be was determined by a variety of factors, though the study definitively concluded the helpfulness of this technique. The ability to change air flow can also be used for communicative purposes.

Asian Elephants acquire inaccessible food by blowing
Many animals use tools such as sticks and sometimes water to acquire food. Elephants have been seen to use blowing to obtain inaccessible food. Two female Asian Elephants in Kamine Zoo, Japan have been observed to use blowing to reach food. This method was tested by placing food in inaccessible locations. The elephants blew the food until it was within reach. In addition, the amount the elephants blew depended upon how out of reach the food was. One of the elephants demonstrated that her blowing was related to the distance of the food. She would blow longer for further away food. Thus, elephants used blowing not only to bring food within reach but for fine-tuning adjustments for ease of grabbing. Additionally, variations were seen in individual use of the technique. This data supports spontaneous problem solving in large mammals.
