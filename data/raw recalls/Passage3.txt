Picture-object recognition among tortoises(chelenoidis carbonaria)
Recognizing a picture from an object is a cognitively demanding task. It involves understanding the object representation in the picture and retain it to understand the differences. The authors started to conduct an experiment among red-footed tortoises to study the effects of picture object recognition among them. It had two experiments. In experiment 1, the tortoises were trained to distinguish between food and non-food objects. After training, the tortoises still recognized some correspondence between pictures and actual objects. The second experiment involved making the tortoises to recognize difference between food and pictures of food. The tortoises were confused between both, as they could not clearly recognize the difference between actual food and the pictorial representation of it. The authors conclude by saying that the tortoises did not have cognitive ability to distinguish an object from its picture.

Picture-object recognition in the tortoise
Determining an object from its representational image and abstracting its function is cognitively complex. Studies have been made on determining picture-object recognition in mammals and birds, but not reptiles. This study examined the picture-object recognition in the red footed tortoise. In the first experiment, 5 red footed tortoises were presented with food and a color image of the food. They successfully passed the tests and practices, suggesting a correspondence between the object and the representational image. The second experiment further examined that correspondence, and when given food and an image of food, they were unable to recognize the difference between the two objects. This suggests tortoises have limited understanding of representational images.

Object-picture recognition capability in the tortoise
Recognizing a link between a real-life object and a photo representation of it is a cognitively complex task. This ability has been studied in mammals and birds, but not in reptiles. In this study, Experiment 1 involved training tortoises to differentiate between food and non-food objects. When the food and non-food objects were replaced with pictorial representations, the performance of the tortoises did not change. This suggested some recognition and association between the real-life object and pictorial image. In Experiment 2, when presented with an option between the real object and its associated pictorial representation, tortoises were confused and did not choose with consistency, suggesting a lack of complete comprehension of object-picture dichotomy.

Tortoise and picture-object recognition
Recognizing that a picture is a visual representation of a real object is a difficult cognitive task. Picture-to-object recognition has only been observed in a few mammal and bird species. This study looked at 5 red-footed tortoises and their representational abilities. In the first experiment, the tortoises first had to discern between food and non-food objects through forced decision. Then those food objects were replaced by their picture counterparts and the tortoises could not tell that these were photos. In the second experiment, the tortoises had to chose between the real food object and its photographic counterpart and there was no difference indicating that tortoises do not have representational insight of pictures.

Red-Footed Tortoise 
Scientists tested to see if reptiles, namely the red-footed tortoise, could recognize and then abstract a object by distinguishing between real objects and photos. Using two alternative forced choice trials, researchers found that the red-footed tortoise succeeded at distinguishing between the two in trial 1, but failed in trial 2. This led the experimenters to conclude that the red-footed tortoise was unable to distinguish and abstract objects.

Picture-object recognition in a tortoise species
Picture-object recognition, and the related concept representational insight, are difficult tasks that have so far been observed in a small number of mammal and bird species. This particular phenomenon has, however, not yet been examined in reptiles. We test a species of tortoise to determine whether they are capable of picture-object recognition. The first experiment involved showing the tortoises a food item and a picture of that item, and then providing the tortoises with a two-option forced choice procedure with the reward of either the food or the picture of food. The tortoises' rates of picking the two options did not differ significantly, showing that they do make some kind of equivalence between the actual food and the picture of it. However experiment 2 investigated the nature of that equivalence by presenting tortoises with two choices, the food and the picture, simultaneously, and the results suggested that tortoises confuse the food for the picture, and thus do not exhibit, in this context, representational insight.

Picture-object representation in tortoises 
Identifying the correspondence between photos and objects, and that the photos are a representation of those objects is a mentally difficult task. This capability has been identified in a few species, but has not been tested for in reptiles. Researchers trained tortoises in a two-choice evaluation. They were first presented with food and another object, and they chose the food. Then, they were presented with a photo of food and a photo of another object. The same proportion which chose the food in the first part chose the photo of the food. This indicates that they associated the image of food with food. In the second experiment, the tortoises were presented with food and with a photo of food. They became confused, and there was no clear choice between the two. This indicates that tortoises can associate images with what they represent, but they cannot identify images as a representation, but instead confuse it with the subject of the images.

Picture -object recognition in red tortoises
The ability to associate pictures with objects is a very intellectually demanding ability. It shows that the individual can abstract the picture and connect it to an object. Mammals and birds have been shown to have this ability. However, reptiles have not been tested yet. A group of 5 tortoises were chosen for this experiment. They were first trained to select from a food vs nonfood object using a forced choice procedure. Then, they were given pictures of the food and nonfood objects and had to pick. The results showed that there were no differences between the training and the test. This shows that tortoises have the ability to recognize images and their real life object. Next, the tortoises were given the choice between a picture of food and actual food. This time, the tortoises had a hard time choosing. This shows that tortoises use the same part of their brain for recognizing food, whether as an image or an object, but have a hard time distinguishing between them.

Can tortoises discern photos from actual objects?
In experiment 1, 5 red nose tortoises were trained to discern food from non food items. They were all successful in learning how to discern them. In experiment 2, these same tortoises were shown pictures of food next to actual food, and were made to discern them. It was found that they were unable to tell the difference, suggesting that they lack the ability to interpret the difference between representations and an actual object.

Tortoises confuse pictorial representations of 3D objects with the 3D objects themselves.
The ability to recognize a pictorial/photographical representation of a 3D object requires a great amount of cognitive engagement. While this ability has been tested in mammals and birds, this experiment was the first to test reptiles. This experiment involved 5 red-footed tortoises, and had two main parts. For the first part, once trained and conditioned to recognize food in its real, 3D form, the tortoises participated in a force-choice test where they were shown photographs of the food. There was no difference in their responses to the pictures of food and the actual food, showing that they could recognize the 2D picture's resemblance to its 3D counterpart. For the second part of this experiment, tortoises were allowed to choose between the real, 3D food and the photograph of the food. This proved to be confusing, and many tortoises chose the photograph rather than the actual food. This demonstrates that while tortoises can see the resemblance between objects in the physical world and pictures of these objects, they do not have the ability to distinguish between the two.

Visual recognition in red-footed tortoises
Recognizing a 2D image of an object as that object is a mentally straining task. While this skill has been successfully tested in a few mammal and bird species, there is currently no information about this skill in reptiles. Red-footed tortoises were trained to recognize food and non-food objects using a two-alternative mandatory-choice test, then presented with a 2D representation of the food. Tortoises often chose the representation of the food object, showing that they have some level of recognition of images as those objects. Furthermore, when presented with both the actual food and a 2D image of the food, tortoises would equally choose either option.

Can tortoises tell pictures apart from real life
In some mammals and birds, telling pictures apart from physical objects has been shown to be a skill, however this has never been tested in reptiles.  Experimenters tested whether or not tortoises could do this.  In experiment one, they trained the tortoise to distinguishing between food and non food by forcing a two option test.  They then replaced both objects with picture of the objects and the tortoises showed that they still knew which picture to go to.  In the second experiment, they had real food and a picture of food, and the tortoises were confused and could not tell the difference.

Ability of tortoises to differentiate pictorial and physical representations of food
The ability of animals to discriminate between visual/pictorial representations of objects, and their real-world counterparts, is an important natural phenomenon that has been observed before in rats and birds. However, at the time of this study, similar studies had not been conducted for reptiles. In this experiment, the red-footed tortoise was exposed in multiple trials to physical food, as well as pictures of said food. The tortoise performed well in identifying the food but was not able to identify the difference between the food and the picture, which led it to regard the picture as the food. This demonstrates that tortoises are unable to discriminate between visual and physical representations of objects.

Turtles and Photo-Object Recognition
Scientists were curious as to see how animals reacted to representations of objects versus objects themselves; would they be able to discern any difference? In this experiment, five red-footed turtles were presented first an actual physical object, and then a photographic representation of it. After the testing and trial periods (in which no clear differentiation or hesitation was observed), the turtles were forced to select either the actual object itself or its photographic representation. The turtles frequently went with the photograph, giving credence to the belief that the turtles saw no tangible or immediately discernible difference between the actual object and a representation of it.

Picture-object recognition in Tortoises
The ability to recognize an object in a picture is an demanding cognitive task. First, you must see the visual representation (the picture) and associate it with a real life object with which you are familiar. Studies have been conducted to understand this process in mammals and birds, but it not understood in reptiles. In this experiment, 5 red-footed tortoises were tested. In Experiment 1, the tortoises were given a forced choice task, where they chose food. Then, the food was replaced with a color image of the food. The tortoises were able to choose the pictures, suggesting that they had an understanding that that pictures were representing the objects of the food. In Experiment 2, the food and picture were mixed. Tortoises were confused and often choose the picture rather than the food, showing that, for the purpose of this experimente, they did not understand that the picture was not the same as the food.
