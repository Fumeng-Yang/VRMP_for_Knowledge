Lions(Panthera Leo) can solve, learn and remember novel resource acquisition task
Social intelligence usually evolves in those social creates whose social life is highly problematic because they advance their cognitive ability. The authors studied about 12 lions as to whether they are able to solve, learn and remember a novel task - the suspended puzzle. At the end of the experiment the authors found that 11 out of 12 lions were able to solve the novel task. Not only that they succeeded repeatedly if asked to solve with minimal difference of time between tasks. Also, they were able to remember it and solve after 7 months. Even those 4 lions who failed to solve were successful when placed them along with successful ones. This study indicates the cognitive ability of lions to solve, learn and remember a novel task. The authors claim that this is also the second study to perform such an experiment.

Lions perform novice task for resource acquisition
Lions were able to perform novice tasks. 11 out of 12 were able to complete the novice task--the 'puzzle box'--which required learning and recalling a task. Lions that were unable to pass on their own achieved later success when they were paired with a successful lion. This experiment was only the second experimental test on lion cognition. The positive results of lions completing tasks suggest there should be more research into the cognition of lions.

Lions exhibit novel problem-solving abilities, memory, increased speed
The social theory of cognition suggests that sociability increases cognitive abilities among highly social animals compared to nonsocial animals and encouraged the evolution of heightened intelligence among social animal species. The present study tested this theory among a group of lions, an ideal species to test this theory given lions' high sociability and egalitarian social structure, with an unusual test: a suspended puzzle box. The majority of the lions (11/12) demonstrated novel problem-solving abilities, decreased latency to complete the task, and memory capacities enabling them to remember how to complete the task seven months later. Moreover, initially unsuccessful individuals (4/5) were able to complete the task when paired with successful lions, demonstrating social learning abilities. This was the first such cognitive study of lions, opening the door to future cognitive studies of this highly social species.

Lions solve, learn, and remember novel resource acquisition problem
The social intelligence hypothesis poses that existing within a complex social structure is correlated with higher cognitive intelligence in organisms. Lions are a relevant species to study because they are a highly social animal living in relatively egalitarian social structures. They were presented with a novel resource acquisition problem: the suspended puzzle box. The study required them to solve the problem, learn the techniques used to successfully solve the puzzle, and remember those techniques for repeated use over time. Most of the lions did this successfully, repeating the task with less and less error, and remembering the task up to a 7-month time gap. There was also evidence of some social facilitation. Four of the five initially unsuccessful lions were able to learn the task after being paired with a successful lion. These results show that more studies should be conducted on lions.

Advanced cognition in social animals: are lions able to learn novel tasks and remember the skills overtime?
Advanced cognition is often seen in social animals, several experiments have also been done on different social animals. Lions can be a perfect subjects in such studies because they are social animals with a relatively more egalitarian social structure. In this experiment, there are 12 lions recruited in performing a novel task: suspended puzzle box. Out of the 12 lions, 11 of them can successfully perform the tasks, and perform them successfully repeatedly, and acquire the skills and memory after a long time. Some of them even retain their memory after 7 months. 5/6 lions also show success after being paired with those who can successfully perform

Lions exhibit cognitive skills through a puzzle
Lions are social animals that have social intelligence and can be used to understand cognition better. 12 lions were participants in this study to solve the suspended puzzle. 11 out of 12 lions were successful in the task. They also showed improved latency to success over the trials  and were able to remember techniques for the task 6 months later. The lions that had trouble were paired with the successful lions and these lions also were able to succeed in the task.

Lions solve, learn, and remember a novel resource acquisition problem
The social intelligence hypothesis posits that the challenges of complex social life bolster the evolution of intelligence, and therefor, advanced cognition has resulted in convergent evolution in several social lineages. Lions are an ideal model system for cognitive research because they are a highly social species with egalitarian social structure. The researchers investigated cognition in lions using a novel resource task: the suspended puzzle box. The task required lions (N=12) to solve a task, learn the techniques necessary to solve the task, and remember the techniques employed for later use in solving the task. Lions (11/12) achieved success, decreased in latency of success over repeated trials, and remembered how to solve the task 7 months later. The lions also demonstrated capabilities in social facilitation of learning: 4 out of 5 initially unsuccessful lions managed to complete the task successfully when partnered with a successful lion. Overall, the researchers findings support evidence for advanced cognition in lions in novel problem-solving and memory over time. To the best of their knowledge, the researchers are only the second group so far to study cognition in lions. These findings provide evidence that lions are worthwhile subjects of cognition studies, and the researchers suggest expanding more cognitive research to these animals.

Lions solve, learn and repeat novel problems
it is hypothesized that the more social a species is, the more intelligent it is. In this experiment, lions were chosen, as they are highly social and have an egalitarian structure. The lions were given a task to solve, and were observed on whether they were able to recall it in the future. Most lions (11/12) were able to do so, and could repeat the task and remember how to solve it to up to 7 months in the future. Out of the 5 lions who were not successful in solving the problem, once another lion demonstrated the task, 4 were able to follow. This shows that lions, highly social creatures, have the ability to solve, learn and repeat novel problems, supporting the initial hypothesis.

Lions solve, learn and remember solutions to novel problems.
12 lions were being studied because of their complex social dynamics. The authors of the study were trying to very the social intelligence hypothesis which suggests that it's possible that social dynamics could force an animal to become more intelligent. They thought that lions have high social intelligence and an egalitarian social system, so they might be interesting subjects for the study. They gave the lions a novel puzzlebox problem. Most of the lions were successful in solving it (11 out of 12 of them). Moreover, 4 out of 5 unsuccessful lions were successful after being paired with a successful lion. The lions also seemed to retain their solutions to the problem for long periods - up to 7 month intervals from the last time a trial was run. With increasing numbers of trials, the latency to succeed was even greater. This is pretty remarkable because this is the second social study done on lions, in association with their cognitive abilities.

Lions learn, solve, and remember a novel resource task
The social intelligence hypothesis suggests that cognitive ability comes from social interaction, and animals evolved intelligence along with social complexity. Lions are an ideal species on which to study social interaction and cognitive ability because they are a highly social and egalitarian species. A group of lions (n=12) was given a novel resource acquisition task in order to gauge their cognition during the task, a suspended puzzle box. The lions had to solve the task, learn different techniques to solve it, and remember those techniques for the future. Almost all of the lions (11/12) solved the problem. They demonstrated cognitive skills like solving the problem repeatedly, and solving the problem faster each time. The lions demonstrated cognitive skills concerning memory too, because they solved the problem after a 7-month period. There was also limited evidence for social facilitation while problem-solving; 4/5 lines who didn't initially succeed solved the problem successfully after being paired with a successful lion. This demonstrated the cognitive skills of lions with regards to learning, remembering and problem-solving. It's the second-ever study of this kind done on lions, and more experiments on lions are recommended.

Lions solve, learn, and remember novel resource acquisition problems
According to the social intelligence hypothesis, animals that experience complex social interactions develop greater intelligence capacities, resulting in the convergence of heightened intellectual abilities in several social lineages. Lions are a great species to test this hypothesis on, as they are very sociable. This experiment used 12 lions and the suspended puzzle box novel problem. 11 out of 12 lions successfully solved the problem. They were also able to remember how to solve the problem even 7 months later. Additionally, almost all of the lions that were not successful solving the problem alone were successful after having been partnered with a successful lion. These results show that lions have impressive abilities to solve, learn, and remember problems, and supports an investment into more research into the cognitive abilities of lions.

Lions solve, learn, and remember novel-puzzle tasks
There is a hypothesis which suggests that socialization helps develop cognitive abilities, and thus, social species evolve to have larger cognitive abilities. In this experiment, lions were studied because of their social, egalitarian lifestyle. 12 lions were given a suspended puzzle box to solve. Most lions (11/12) were able to solve the puzzle, learn the technique, and remember the solution when presented with it again. Lions were able to successfully repeat the solution up to a period of 7-months afterwards. Additionally, of the five lions who were not able to figure out the puzzle, four of them were able to be successful when placed with a successful lion. Thus, the lions were able to solve puzzles, and their solutions improved in social situations. This is only the second study to be done on the cognitive learning ability of lions and will pave the way for future studies to take place.
