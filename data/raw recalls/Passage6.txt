Giant pandas fail to exhibit mirror self-recognition
An extensive body of literature has tested mirror self-recognition (MSR) as a measure of self-awareness and cognitive ability among social mammalian species, such as dolphins, lions, and Asian elephants. However, few studies have been conducted on MSR as a measure of cognition in solitary mammalian species. The present study conducted four different tests of MSR ((1) closed mirror test; (2) tank mirror test; (3) water mark test; and (4) marking test) on thirty-four male and female giant pandas in captivity, ranging in age from juvenile to sub-adult to adult. The study concluded that regardless of age and gender, giant pandas were unable to exhibit MSR-related behaviors, notably consistently failing to touch a mark on their heads. Instead, all the pandas exhibited aggressive and nervous behaviors suggesting that they viewed their mirror images as a different individual of the same species.

Giant pandas failed in mirror self-recognition task
Mirror self-recognition is the ability of an organism to recognize itself in a mirror image. It is considered a precursor or indication of self-awareness and individual development. Studies have been conducted on Asian elephants and dolphins, but not many with isolated mammalian subjects. Thirty four giant pandas were used in this study, ranging in all ages. Despite being presented with a variety of mirror experiments (including covered mirror and open mirror), the pandas did not show signs of self-recognition by touching the mark. Regardless of age, pandas reacted to their mirror image as if it were another organism, displaying behavior such as back walking or attacking. The results suggest that pandas of any age do not show mirror self-recognition, and further studies should be done with large mammals performing the task, with implications for animal captivity design.

Giant Pandas fail to recognize Mirror Self Recognition 
Mirror self recognition is the ability to recognize one's reflection in a mirror. Most social animals like chimpanzees are able to recognize themselves and a lot of research exists; however less research exists for pandas. 34 giant pandas were exposed to 4 different mirror orientations: 1) covered mirror 2) uncovered mirror 3) water tank mirror 4) curtain mirror to see whether they could recognize themselves regardless of age. All pandas regardless of age, although they first showed signs of aggression and tried to touch the mark on their forehead, they did not show ability to recognize themself.

Giant Pandas fails to show mirror self-recognition
The phenomena of mirror self-recognition (MSR, and MSR thereafter), i.e. the fact that animals are able to recognize themselves in the mirror, are often observed in social animals. Such experiments have been successfully conducted on social species such as Asian elephants, dolphins, and etc, and the results show that these animals do possess the MSR ability. However, less is known about solitary animals. And thus, the experimenters are interested in conducting such experiments on giant pandas to investigate 1)whether giant pandas have MSR ability; and 2) whether their ability has to do with their ages. In this experiment, they ask 34 giant pandas (F:M=16:18, including juveniles, sub-adults and adults) to perform the tasks in 4 different settings: 1) covered mirror tasks; 2) open mirror tasks; 3) water mark control tasks; and 4) mark tasks. What the results show is that, though in average there is not much difference in terms of how long the giant pandas stare at the window, none of the giant pandas show any sign of MSR ability, i.e. none of them touch the mark on their head in the mirror. Moreover, what the experimenters have found is that, the giant pandas also tend to show aggressive behaviors such as attacking the mirrors when they perform the tasks, suggesting that they probably treat the mirrors as non-specifics. As a conclusion, the experimenters conclude that giant pandas do not possess  the ability to recognize themselves in the mirror, regardless of their ages; and this result might provide more insights into the study of captive animal management.

Giant panda mirror self-recognition
Mirror self-recognition is an important part of evolution. Intelligent mammals such as chimpanzees are able to recognize themselves in the mirror. Previous work has not tested whether isolated mammals such as bears and pandas have mirror self-recognition. In an experiment, giant pandas were found to not have mirror self-recognition, using various tests. They did not use the reflection to try to touch a water mark on them, and they displayed aggressive and territorial behavior when seeing themselves in the mirror.

Giant pandas failed to show mirror self recognition
Mirror self recognition is the ability to recognize oneself in front of a mirror. Many species like chimpanzees, elephants in previous studies have shown mirror self recognition abilities but little literature existed for giant pandas. The aim of the study was to identify mirror recognizing abilities and whether it varied with age. The study used 34 giant pandas who were exposed to a mirror, and generally, most of them regardless of age first showed aggressiveness and scratched, pointed, etc. All of the giant pandas however failed to show mirror self recognition in general.

Giant pandas fail to display mirror self-recogniction
Mirror self-recognition (MSR) is regarded as a strong indicator for self-recognition and personal identity in animals. While well-documented in social animals such as chimpanzees, Asian elephants, and dolphins, little research has been done on this topic in solitary mammalian species. The behavior of 34 giant pandas (F:M 18:16, juvenile, sub-adult, and adult) in front of a covered mirror, an open mirror, a water mark control test, and a mark test was studied by researchers. All of the pandas, adult, sub-adult and juvenile, displayed aggressive behavior, pawing, dragging a foot across the ground, and stepping back from the mirror. None of them used the mirror to touch the spot on their head where the mark in the mirror appeared, a task that is regarded as an indicator for successful MSR. Thus, the pandas failed to recognize themselves in the mirror, but rather regarded the panda in the mirror as a conspecific animal. This research may help inform the decisions of giant panda caretakers and design of spaces for giant pandas kept in captivity.

pandas fail to identify themselves in the mirror
Some animals are able to recognize themselves in the mirror. To test this, pandas in captivity were tested to see if they could recognize their own selves. Four different parts were tested. As a result, it was found that pandas were unable to identify the figures in the mirrors as themselves. Some pandas showed aggressive behavior when faced with a mirror, and they did not touch their heads when the mirror indicated that there was something, like a spot, on their heads. This shows that pandas are unable to identify themselves in the mirror (MSR test fail).

Panda Beuaty 
Mirror self-representation is an important factor in forming self-identity, and researchers looked at male and female panda across three age brackets to see if pandas, were capable of MSR. The results were negative in that the pandas showed no recognition of themselves in the tests provided.

Giant pandas fail mirror self recognition tests
Mirror self recognition, in which an animal is placed in front of a mirror and is tested to determine whether it recognizes that what it sees is a reflection of itself, is a common test of self recognition and intelligence in animals, and has been used to test chimpanzees, apes, and dolphins. However, this test has not been performed on pandas. 34 captive pandas were used in the test, with several different methods of presenting the mirrors to them. In all cases, they failed to recognize that the image was themselves, as determined by whether they reached for a marking placed on their heads. Instead, they showed aggressive behavior toward the mirror image, including scratching and backwards walking. This provides potential insight into panda behavior, as well as practical use in enclosure design.

Do giant pandas recognize themselves in the mirror?
Mirror self recognition is considered a potential index for self recognition in animals, according to the study. Authors of the study say that social animals, mammals and apes in particular, have been observed to be able to recognize themselves in the mirror. The authors were curious about whether this holds for giant pandas, which are generally considered more isolationist by the authors. The authors took 34 giant pandas (18 female, 16 male) of all ages: juveniles, sub-adults, and adults, and ran four kinds of mirror tests on them. These tests involved (1) partially covered mirrors (2) open mirrors (3) water mark label mirrors and (4) other marked label mirrors. The authors noticed that what they took to be the primary sign that the animal could recognize itself (i.e. the animal touches the spot on its head in the mirror image) was missing in the case of giant pandas. The authors claimed that the pandas uniformly reacted socially, aggressively, towards their mirror images; making threatening expressions, sounds, and poses.

Giant pandas fail to show Mirror self-recognition
MSR (Mirror self-recognition) is commonly used as an indicator of self-awareness and individual self-formation in mammals. Although studies on MSR have been done on social animals like chimps and dolphins, there have not been studies on the Mirror self-recognition of solitary animals. This study was done on a group of thirty-four Giant Pandas (F:M 16:18) of varying ages -- juvenile, sub-adult, and adult. Researchers tested all the pandas for Mirror self-recognition using four tests: open mirror test, closed mirror test, marking test with control, marking. Although all of the pandas of all ages showed about the same level of social engagement with the mirrored images, none of the pandas engaged with the markings on their own heads, a common indicator of self-recognition. The pandas reacted to the mirror images with aggression, threatening, foot scraping and backwards walking. This study contributes to the body of current knowledge about self-recognition in solitary animals. It can be useful for enclosure design and future work with captive animals.

Giant pandas of all ages fail to achieve mirror self-recognition
While very social species such as dolphins and elephants have been shown to display mirror self-recognition (MSR), solitary species (such as giant pandas) have not been tested for this ability. This experiment involved 34 giant pandas (18 females and 16 males of all different ages: juvenile, sub-adult, and adult), and there were 4 aspects to the experiment: the covered mirror test, open mirror test, water mark test, and mark test. The results of this experiment showed that the pandas of all sexes and ages displayed threatened or threatening behavior (foot-scraping, backing up) upon seeing their reflection. None of them touched the mark on their heads, which would have been a sign of self-recognition.

Giant pandas fail to show Mirror Self Recognition
Mirror self recognition is the ability to recognize oneself in the mirror, and is an important measure of self recognition and individual development. There has been a wealth of literature on MSR in social animals such as the dolphin, Asian elephant, and chimpanzees,  but none on solitary mammals such as the giant panda. This study was conducted to show whether giant pandas can recognize themselves in a mirror. 34 giant pandas of all ages were gathered and tested in 4 main tests: 1. open mirror tests 2. closed mirror tests 3. water mark control tests 4. mark tests. The results showed that while pandas of all age groups spent considerable time in front of mirrors, they did not touch the mark on their head, a behavior that indicates mirror self recognition. Instead, they demonstrated threatening behavior, aggressiveness, and backwards walking. This shows that giant pandas failed to recognize themselves in the mirror. These results add to the data we have on large mammals, solitary animals, and can be used for captive animal management.

Do pandas have mirror recognition?
Mirror recognition is often used as a metric of an animal's sense of self. Pandas were tested in this study to see if they were able to recognize themselves in the mirror, with a covered mirror test, open mirror test, and others. It was found that pandas failed all of these tests, suggesting that they do not have a sense of self sufficient to recognize themself as distinct from other creatures.

Giant Pandas cannot recognize themselves in a mirror
MSR or Mirror Self recognition is an animals ability to recognize themselves in a mirror.  This is important in development and self-awareness.  Researches wanted to test Giant Pandas living in captivity and how well they were able to do in a test of MSR over different ages.  They found that all pandas were unable to recognize themselves.  They failed when a mark was put on their forehead, and they often became aggressive when they saw themselves in the mirror.  This includes walking backward or paw stomping at the sight of themselves.

Giant pandas fail to exhibit mirror self-recognition
Mirror self-recognition (or MSR) is when beings recognize themselves in mirrors. It is a key piece of information that helps us observe whether or not organisms have strong concepts of self. MSR has been recognized in chimpanzees, elephants, and dolphins, but there has not been a lot of studies done on solitary mammalian species. An experiment was done on a group of 34 giant pandas (F:M, 18:16; with juveniles, young-adults, and adults) that presented the pandas with a series of MSR tasks. They were tested in a 1) open mirror task, 2) closed mirror, 3) water control mark test, 4) mark test. All of the ages spent a similar amount of time engaging in social behavior with the mirror, but all of them failed to use the mirror to find the mark and touch it. At first, all of the pandas were aggressive towards the mirror, engaging in backstepping, attacking, and aversion. These results show that the pandas were unable to recognize themselves with the mirrors. This experiment can help in the future determine how to design habitats for pandas and other structures.

Asian Pandas and the Mirror-Image; Self-Reflection 
Many animals have failed to be cognizant of their reflection as its own self when presented with a mirror or some other type of visual reflector. In this experiment, Asian pandas were observed looking at themselves in the mirror. Scientists took notes as to how they reacted, how they behaved long term, and whether or not they actually realized that the presence they were observing was, in fact, them. Though the pandas did not reach for the marks on their forehead - a general sign of mirror-recognition - they stomped backwards and performed a series of gestures and movements which indicated that this was not perceived by the pandas to be their own reflection so much as a coexisting member of the same species.

Giant pandas do not recognize themselves in mirrors
Mirror Self-Recognition (MSR), that is recognizing one's reflection in a mirror, is used as a measure of self-recognition. Self-recognition is used to determine cognitive ability in animals. Large social mammals such as elephants have shown self-recognition. However, few studies have been performed on solitary species. In this study, 36 giant pandas (F:M 18:16, juvenile, sub-adult, adult) were exposed to covered mirrors, open mirrors, water marked mirrors, and mark mirrors. Across all ages, pandas did not self-recognize their reflections in the mirrors. When a mark was placed on their heads, no pandas reached to touch the mark when looking in the mirror, suggesting that they did not understand that they were looking at their reflections. Pandas encountering a mirror attacked, grunted, or backed up, showing that they did not see the panda in the mirror as their reflection. This study helps to understand self-recognition in large mammals.
