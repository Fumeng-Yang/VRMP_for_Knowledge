<div id="firstboard">
    <h1> Part
        <span id="partx">0</span> â€“ Read the Passages </h1>
    <p>
        <b>Next, you will read a series of passages</b> and
        <b>recall after you finish reading. Keep in mind that you need to put your recall in the original order you read.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>To repeat the reading guidelines </u>: <br>Read the passages at your own pace and make sure each sentence makes sense to
        you. Try to remember the gists. You will be asked to recall as much of the passages as you could later. But please do not attempt to memorize
        the passages word by word.
    </p>
    <p>
        As before, we blur the reading materials on purposes. You have to move the mouse onto a passage in order to read it. Try
        the technique here:
        <span class="blurtext">(test)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, please click the
        <q>Next</q> button to proceed. You have up to
        <b>30 min</b> to read on next page.
    </p>
