    <p>
        You read a series of passages selected from scientific publications yesterday.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, we ask you to recall and write down the passages you read yesterday
        <b>as completely as possible</b>. The tasks are:
        <p>
            <b>1) write your recall of each passage separately, including both the titles and bodies;</b>
            <br>
            <b>2) sort them in the original order you read by dragging the entries.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>To repeat the recalling guidelines</u>:
            <br> It is not necessary to reproduce the original wording. In other words, you donâ€™t have to worry about exact
            wording, but do use the original wording for terminology. We want to see what and how much you can remember after 24 hours. 
            We don't check spelling and grammar, as long as we can recognize what you mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are ready, please proceed to the recall page. You have up to
            <b>30 min</b> in the recall task on next page.
        </p>
