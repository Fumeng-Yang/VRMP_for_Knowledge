    <p>
        You just finished reading all the passages. Take a break.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you feel more real, we ask you to recall and write down what you can remember for what you just read
        <b>as completely as possible</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tasks for your are,
        <br>
        <b>1) Write your recall of each passage separately, using the
            <q>Memory Palace</q> method.</b>
        <br>
        <b>2) Sort them in the original order you saw. </b>
        <br>
        <b>3) Rate how vivid an illustration is.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>To repeat the recalling instructions</u>:
        <br> <b>Please recall by
        imagining you see the coffee shop, walking through the route, and trying to pick up the connections (visualizations) between
            the locations and the passages. </b> What is it about? What are details in the visualization that reflect the
        passage you read? In your recall, it is NOT necessary to reproduce the original wording. We want to see what and
        how much you can remember when you read the passages once for careful understanding.    We don't check spelling and grammar, as long as we can recognize what you mean.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are ready, please click the
        <q>Next</q> button to proceed to the recall page.
        <br> You have up to
        <b>30 min</b> in the recall task on next page.
