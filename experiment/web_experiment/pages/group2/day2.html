<h1>Experimental Overview</h1>
<div id="day2instruction">
    <p>Thank you for coming back. </p>
    <p> Yesterday, we asked you to read a series of passages carefully in virtual
            reality using the <q>Memory Palace</q> method. Today, <b>weâ€˜d like to test how much you can remember after 24 hours in the
        same way you did yesterday.</b>
    </p>

        <p>The following sessions are: revisit your palace - recall - recognition - survey questions</p>
        <p>Remember to turn off or stay away from your cell phone(s) and other electronic devices that can interrupt you.
           If you have any question, please ask the experimenter(s) before you proceed to the main study. 
        </p>
