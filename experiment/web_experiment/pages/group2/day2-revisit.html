    <h1> Part 1 - Revisit Your Palace</h1>
    <p>
        Remember the coffee shop in virtual reality you visited yesterday. Now, we ask you to revisit
        <span class="scene">the coffee shop</span> and redraw the connections (imaginary visualizations) you built between what you read and
        what you seen. After this, we will ask you to write down your recall for the passages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ask the experimenter to help you put on virtual reality devices. The tasks for this session is just to revisit and recall:
        <br>
        <br />
        <b>1) Walk around and get familiar with the scene and the series of locations (the route) again. </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>2) Walking through the locations one by one in the same order you did it yesterday. Repeat the process multiple times
            until you are comfortable with the route;</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>3) For each location, recall what the visaulization you created yesterday in order to
            <q>connect</q> the location to the passage;</b>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Practice this journey multiple times until you feel comfortable with whatever you can recall or you have nothing to
        add. You may not remember everything. Try your best! When you are done, ask the experimenter(s) to help you take
        off the VR device. 
    </p>

        Do not click
        <q>Next</q> until you come back.
