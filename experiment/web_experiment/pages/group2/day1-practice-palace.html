        Thanks, you passed! Next, you will take a practice. You will use VR and the memory palace method with one passage. You will
        read the passage and associate it to a target location in virtual reality, come back to write down your recall, and
        finish a small recognition task.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, click
        <q>Next</q> to see the detailed instructions.

<div class="board" id="secondboard" style="display:none;">
    Basically, you ask the experimenter(s) to proceed for each of these tasks:
    <p>
        <b>1) Play with VR. There will be a simple VR scene with a desk in a room.</b> The experimenter will introduce VR and
        what you can do in this scene.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2) Ask the experiment to show you the passage, and read it carefully in virtual reality. </b>
        <br>
        <u>How to read the passages</u>:
        <br> Read the abstract at your own pace and make sure each sentence makes sense to you. You will be asked to recall as
        much of the passages as you could remember afterwards. But please do not attempt to memorize the passages word by
        word.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>3) Build a connection between the desk (the target location) and the passage using imagination. </b>
        <br>
        <u>How to build a connection: </u>
        <br> Try to visualize what you read as objects, stories, images, and animations. The visualization should be as incredible
        and appealing as possible. It should provide you enough hints to help you recall the content of the passage later.
        We will ask you to write down what you can remember about the passage later. Repeat the imagination multiple times
        and confirm yourself you are not going to change the visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br> These instructions will be presented in VR. You can ask any question in this session. Ask the experimenter(s) to
        help you put on / take off the devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experimenter(s) watches your movements while you are in VR to ensure you won't hurt in the reality. But if you feel serious
        motion sickness, please stop immediately, close your eyes, and notify the experimenter(s) to help you out.
    </p>
    <p>
        The expectated time for this session is about 10 min. Please don't click
        <q>Next</q> until you come back.
