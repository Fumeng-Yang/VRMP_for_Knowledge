<h1>Part
    <span id="partx">0</span> â€“ Create a Palace & Memory Palace </h1>
<div id="firstboard">
    <p>
        In the main session, <b>you will create a palace based on
        <font class="scene">a generic coffee shop</font> in virtual reality.  You are going to read and remember 
        a series of passages in virtual reality using the memory palace method.  We will provide you a set of locations to imitate the process of order a cup of coffee. Each of the passages is put at a certain location. You should
        visualize what you are reading and try to link it into that location</b>.
    </p>

        If you wanna skim the memory palace method article again, click
        <a href="../files/Building_Your_Memory_Palaces.pdf" target="_blank">(here)</a> to read it.

        When you are ready, click

        <br> Basically, you ask the experimenter(s) to proceed for each of these tasks:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1) Walk around and get familiar with the scene, then ask the experimenter(s) to show the locations on the route.
        </b>
        <br>Practice the virtual route multiple times as if you are order a cup of coffee; repeat until you feel confidence in remembering all the locations and the
        order.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>2) When ready, ask the experimenter(s) to lead you to the reading session.</b> You start to read the passages carefully.
        <br>
            <u>To repeat the reading guidelines</u>: <br>Read the passages at your own pace and make sure each sentence makes
            sense to you. Try to remember the gists. You will be asked to recall as much of the passages as you could afterwards. But please
            do not attempt to memorize the passages word by word.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3) Build connections between the passages and the locations using your imagination.</b>
   
        <br>
        <u>To repeat how to build a connection</u>: <br>Let your imagination run freely. Try to visualize what you read as objects,
        stories, and images, and try to imagine those are linked to the locations in some way. The visualization should be
        as incredible and appealing as possible. It should provide you enough hints to help you recall the title and the
        content of the passage later. Go through the process of imagining the journey multiple times until you are confident
        with what you have created in your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that you have up to
        <b>30 min</b> once you start reading. Ask the experimenter to help you put on / take off the VR devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The instructions will be given under the VR as well. Please don't click
        <q>Next</q> until you come back.
