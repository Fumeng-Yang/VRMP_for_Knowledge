    <p>Please read the following article about the
        <q>Memory Palace</q>. You will be asked a few questions to test your understanding of the method. </p>

        A memory palace is a mental structure that can help you memorize. It consists of defining a set of locations in your mind.
        Then, use those locations to visualize on them what you want to memorize. In order to remember, you just move along
        the locations (in your mind) retrieving the images in each one. You need to first build at least one memory palace,
        and then you can use it to store things in your memory.
    </p>

    <h3>Build a memory palace: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Define a place.</b> Select a place you want to use as memory palace. This place should be something that can
            be clear in your mind, like your home, your city or your office.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Define a route.</b> In the place you decided, define a set of locations, one after another creating a route that
            uniquely goes from one location to the next, always following the same order.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Memorize the route.</b> You have to have clear in your mind the route you must follow when using the palace.
            Repeat it several times until you know it by heart and can imagine yourself working through the route.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Use a memory palace:</h3>
    <ol>
        Assume you have a list of what you want to remember.
        <li>
            <b>Memorizing</b>: the memorizing process is by connecting one item to one location using imagination.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <b>Start visualizing the first place of your palace and visualize the first item of the list at the first
                        place. You should create vivid visualization that associates the item to the place.</b> Visualizations
                    should make sense to you, but be as incredible and appealing as possible. For example, if the item is
                    the word
                    <q>whale</q> and the place is your bathtub, you can try to imagine a whale swimming in your bathtub.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Repeat with the second location of the palace and the second item of the list and so forth.</b>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Recalling</b>: the recalling process is by imagining yourself walking through the palace and pick up the cues.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <b>Visualize the palace. </b>Move (in your mind) to the first location.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Visualize clearly the location. </b>Soon, your memory will show you the whole image your put on that
                    location.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>From the image you get, retrieve the information (e.g. a word) you memorized at that point.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Repeat with the rest of the locations of the palace.</b>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Now we have a few questions to test your understanding of the method. You have to answer them all correctly in order
        to proceed.
        <b> These questions are supposed to be simple and obvious. Don't think into complicated cases. If you still can't pass
            after your second trial, ask the experimenter to help you.</b>

            <input type="checkBox" name="remembering" id="order" value="order" /> To remember a list of word, I should associate the first word with the first location on my route and so forth.

            <input type="checkBox" name="recalling" id="recall" value="recall" /> From the visualization I get, I can retrieve the information I had memorized. If I
            <q>see</q> a cat, I should be able to recall that I was trying to remember some cat-related information.
            <br />
            <input type="checkBox" name="recalling" id="repeat" value="repeat" /> I repeat for the rest of the locations of the palace, imagining I am walking through the route, and repeating.
