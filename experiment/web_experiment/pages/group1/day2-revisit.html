        Remember the mental coffee shop you created yesterday. You imagined a route in your imaginary coffee shop. Now, we ask you
        to imagine that you walk along the route again and see all the locations. After this, we will ask you to write down your recall for the passages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tasks for this session is just to revisit and recall:
        <br>
        <b>1) Recall the coffee shop and the series of locations we asked you to remember. </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>2) Imagine yourself walking through these locations one by one in the same order you did it yesterday. </b>Repeat the
            process multiple times until you are comfortable with the route;
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>3) For each location, recall what visualization that connects it to the corresponding passage.</b>
        <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Practice this mental journey multiple times until you feel comfortable with whatever you can recall or you have nothing to
        add. You may not remember everything. Try your best!
