<h1>Experiment Overview</h1>
<div id="day1instruction">
    <p>
        There are three main tasks in this experiment:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1) Learn a memory method called
            <q>Memory Palace</q> (also called
            <i>Method of loci</i>).</b>
        <br>
        <b> 2) We will give you a set of locations, and you will use them as your
            <q>palace</q> to read and remember a series of passages from scientific publications.</b>
        <br>
        <b> 3) Recall the passages as complete as you can.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following sessions are: explanation of our expectation - training - practice - main session.
    </p>
    <p>
        There might be latin names in the passages. You can straightly ignore them.
        <br> Remember to turn off or stay away from your cell phone(s) and other electronic devices that can interrupt you.
