        Thanks, you passed! Next, you will practice the memory palace method with one passage.
        <br> You will read the passage, associate it to a target location we provide, write down your recall, and finish a small recognition
        task.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, click
        <q>Next</q> to proceed.

    <img src="../files/table_scene.png" alt="practice picture" width="100%">
    <p>
        A desk and a window. We want you to imagine that you are inside the above picture.
        <br> Imagine yourself are standing in the picture, facing the desk and the window. There are some items put on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't have to imagine all the details (e.g., materials) about the desk and the window. The goal for you is to get a sense of the existence
        of them and where they are to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pause for a while to imagine this scene. When you feel confidence in your illustration, please click
        <q>Next</q> to proceed.
