        Now, we ask you to write down what you can remember about the passages.
        <br>
        <p>
            The tasks for your are,
            <br>
            <b>1) Write down your recalls of each passage separately by utilizing the imaginary visualizations you created yesterday;
                </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2) Sort them in the original order you saw. </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>3) Rate how vivid an illustration is.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>The recalling guidelines</u>:
            <br> Please recall by
            <b>imagining you see the coffee shop, walking through the route, try to pick up the connections (visualizations) between
                the locations and the passages. </b> What is it about? What are details in the visualization that reflect
            the passage you read? In your recall, it is NOT necessary to reproduce the original wording. We want to see what
            and how much you can remember after 24 hours. 
            We don't check spelling and grammar, as long as we can recognize what you mean.
        </p>

        <p>
            Click
            <q>Next</q> to proceed. You have up to
            <b>30 min</b> in the recall task on next page.
