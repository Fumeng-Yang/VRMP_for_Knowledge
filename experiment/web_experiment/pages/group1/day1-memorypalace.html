<h1> Part <span id="partx">3</span> –  Memory Palace </h1>
<p>
    Next, you will use your mental coffee shop as your palace and read a series of passages. The tasks for your are,
</p>

<p>
    <b>1) Read each passage carefully.</b> 
</p>

<p>
    <b>2) Build connections between the passages and the locations using your imagination. </b>
    Link each passage to one of the locations in your mental coffee shop <b>in the same order</b>. 
    For example, you should associate the first location with the first passage using your wild imagination. 
</p>

<p>
        <u>To repeat the reading guidelines </u>: <br>Read the passages at your own pace and make sure each sentence makes sense to you. 
        Try to remember the gists. You will be asked to recall as much of the passages as you could later. 
        But please do not attempt to memorize the passages word by word. 
        We don’t want you to be interfered during your reading if you feel you have to create a visualization to connect the two to each other.
    </p>
    <p>   
        We blur the reading materials on purposes. 
        You need to move your mouse onto hover the passage in order to read it. Try the technique here: <span class="blurtext">(test)</span>.
    </p>

<p>
    <u>To repeat how to build a connection</u>: <br>Let your imagination run freely. 
    Try to visualize what you read as objects, stories, and images, 
    and try to imagine those are linked to the locations in some way. 
    The visualization should be as incredible and appealing as possible. 
    It should provide you enough hints to help you recall the title and the content of the passage later.
    Go through the process of imagining the journey multiple times until you are confident with what you have created in your mind.
