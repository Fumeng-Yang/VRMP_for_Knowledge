        Now, we ask you to recall and write down the passage you just read
        <b>as completely as possible</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Please recall by imagining you see the desk and the window again and try to pick up the connection (visualization)
            between the desk and the passage</b>. What is it about? What are details in the visualization that reflect the
        passage you read?
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>To repeat the recalling guidelines</u>:<br> 
        It is NOT necessary to reproduce the original wording. In other words, you donâ€™t have to worry about exact wording.
        We want to see what and how much you can remember after you read the passage once for careful understanding. At the
        end, please rate how vivid it is for your illustration.
    </p>

        If you are ready, please click
