        The desk and the table will be used as your palace to build the connection (the imaginary visualization).
    </p>
    The tasks for you are:
    <p>
        <b>1) carefully read the passage on the next page. </b>We blur the reading material on purposes. You need to move the
        mouse onto the passage in order to read it. Try the technique here:
        <span class="blurtext">(test)</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>How to read the passages</u>:
        <br> Read the passage at your own pace and make sure each sentence makes sense to you. You will be asked to recall as
        much of the passage as you could remember afterwards. But please do not attempt to memorize the passage word by
        word.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2) build a connection between the passage and the desk using your imagination and the
            <q>memory palace</q> method</b>.
        <br>
    </p>
    <u>How to build a connection: </u>
    <br> Try to visualize what you read as objects, stories, images, and animations. The visualization should be as incredible
    and appealing as possible. It should provide you enough hints to help you recall the content of the passage later. Repeat
    the imagination multiple times and confirm yourself you are not going to change the visualization.
    </p>

        The expectated time for this session is about 10 min. When you are ready, please click
